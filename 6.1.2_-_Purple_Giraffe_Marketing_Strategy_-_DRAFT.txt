  Industry research and insights The lighting industry is undergoing rapid transformation driven by advancements in smart lighting technology, increased LED adoption, and a growing demand for energy-efficient and sustainable solutions. Government policies and incentives have accelerated the transition toward renewable energy and human-centric lighting, particularly in urban infrastructure projects. However, challenges such as high upfront costs, slow adoption rates, and evolving regulatory standards continue to pose barriers. The market is highly competitive, with both global and local players focusing on innovation, certification, and sustainability to gain market share. Regulatory bodies such as Standards Australia and the Lighting Council of Australia play a crucial role in setting industry benchmarks and ensuring compliance with evolving performance standards. Partnerships with government agencies and sustainability initiatives further shape industry progress, while the increasing influx of imported lighting products intensifies competition, requiring local manufacturers and distributors to remain adaptive and innovative. Consumer demand is shifting towards energy-efficient, sustainable, and technologically advanced lighting solutions. Despite ongoing challenges related to retrofitting costs and system complexities, there is increasing demand for smart and human-centric lighting that enhances comfort, efficiency, and adaptability. Certifications and long-term cost benefits continue to influence purchasing decisions, especially in the commercial and government-funded sectors. Australia and New Zealand’s stringent energy efficiency regulations, net-zero targets, and performance standards are accelerating the transition to LEDs and renewable-powered lighting systems, reshaping industry best practices and improving overall lighting quality. Technological advancements are redefining the industry, particularly through IoT-enabled lighting, LED efficiency improvements, and renewable energy integration. These innovations extend beyond energy savings, with adaptive smart city applications enabling customized lighting solutions for urban environments, workplaces, and residential settings. Organisations such as the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) and the Lighting Council of Australia (LCA) have been instrumental in promoting sustainable lighting practices, supporting the industry through accreditation programs, consumer education, and digital resources. To maintain industry leadership and relevance, professional associations must prioritise sustainability, regulatory compliance, and ongoing industry engagement. Cross-industry collaborations, strategic partnerships, and specialised professional development initiatives will ensure that IESANZ remains a trusted authority in the lighting sector while continuing to support the evolving needs of its members and industry stakeholders.  Industry research actions • Establish a structured industry monitoring process to track emerging trends, competitor activities, and technological advancements. • Regularly review and report on key regulatory updates and assess their impact on IESANZ’s services and industry positioning. • Develop strategic partnerships with research institutions, corporate sponsors, and government bodies to reinforce IESANZ’s thought leadership. 
IESANZ | Marketing Action Plan |  page 7  
  • Publish an annual industry white paper featuring insights from key stakeholders, industry surveys, and data-driven research. • Create a Google Business Page listing all IESANZ chapters and services to enhance online visibility and credibility. • Build ongoing research collaborations with universities and lighting-related research institutions to foster innovation and industry advancements. • Develop a content strategy focused on industry insights, including whitepapers, research reports, and expert-led webinars.  See Appendix 1.

  Comparative summary IESANZ operates within a diverse network of organisations that serve different aspects of the lighting and design industries. While these organisations are not direct competitors, they offer valuable insights into industry best practices, service offerings, and engagement strategies. By refining its branding, digital presence, and member engagement approach, IESANZ has the opportunity to differentiate itself, strengthen industry leadership, and expand its membership base.   Several industry organisations reveal key opportunities for IESANZ to improve its positioning. The LCA is a leading advocate for sustainability and industry regulations but has a limited digital presence, reducing its overall engagement potential. The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) provides extensive academic resources and educational materials, yet lacks accessibility for non-academic professionals, highlighting an opportunity for IESANZ to provide a broader, more practical knowledge base. Meanwhile, Engineers Australia effectively leverages SEO and flexible membership structures but relies heavily on paywalls, which can deter engagement and accessibility.  Design-focused organisations also offer valuable comparisons. The Design Institute of Australia (DIA) supports professional development and networking but faces challenges with complex website navigation, affecting user experience. The Australian Institute of Architects (AIA) provides flexible membership options and strong leadership positioning but underutilises video content and digital storytelling to engage its audience effectively. The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) is a leader in advocacy and community outreach, though it lacks consistent branding across platforms. Similarly, the Institute of Lighting Professionals (ILP) effectively communicates membership benefits and industry transparency, but its SEO strategy and website accessibility require significant improvement to enhance discoverability and engagement.  Despite these comparisons, IESANZ stands out for its broad industry appeal, transparent membership pricing, and strong commitment to education and professional development. However, to maintain leadership and remain competitive, key areas for enhancement include refining branding consistency, expanding its digital presence, improving searchability, and leveraging strategic partnerships. IESANZ can further strengthen its position by broadening educational offerings beyond chapter initiatives, digitising all webinars, and developing a structured online event calendar for improved accessibility.   Competitive summary actions • Enhance branding consistency across all platforms, ensuring alignment with industry leaders while maintaining IESANZ’s unique positioning. • Leverage competitor insights to improve membership benefits, including access to free public-facing resources and exclusive industry reports. • Develop structured partnerships with relevant organisations to co-host educational content, podcasts, and networking events. • Expand industry recognition efforts by integrating IESANZ’s mission into advocacy campaigns, awards promotions, and digital storytelling. • Improve digital accessibility by enhancing website structure, content navigation, and implementing an SEO-driven content strategy.  See Appendix 2.

IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 11 
  SWOT summary IESANZ has built a strong reputation as a leading professional body in the lighting industry, with a century of expertise, accredited educational programs, and industry advocacy. Its regional focus on Australia and New Zealand gives it a unique position to influence lighting standards, sustainability, and industry best practices. Networking opportunities, a vibrant community, and a prestigious awards program further reinforce its credibility and long-standing industry influence. However, digital engagement gaps, inconsistent branding, and limited outreach to younger professionals and underrepresented groups pose challenges. Additionally, membership benefits are not clearly communicated, making it harder to attract and retain members. The lack of structured event coordination and underutilised digital content also reduce engagement, while shifting industry trends demand a stronger focus on innovation and modern learning experiences. Opportunities exist to expand IESANZ’s presence in smart lighting, AI-driven technologies, and digital education, as well as to leverage government incentives and sustainability initiatives to strengthen its industry influence. New partnerships with architects, designers, and technology leaders can broaden its reach, while sponsorship and funding diversification can create long-term financial sustainability. Expanding hybrid and digital event offerings, improving digital accessibility, and strengthening online resources will allow IESANZ to attract new members and retain existing ones. However, IESANZ must also navigate growing competition from global and local industry associations, as well as economic uncertainty, regulatory changes, and the impact of AI-driven automation on traditional networking and education models. Global crises, including wars and pandemics, pose additional risks to event participation, funding, and industry collaboration. Meeting these challenges will require a clearer membership value proposition, stronger branding, improved digital engagement, and proactive adaptation to industry shifts.  SWOT analysis actions • Improve branding and messaging to attract younger professionals and underrepresented groups. • Expand digital learning by increasing the availability of webinars, virtual events, and on-demand technical training. • Develop industry partnerships with architects, designers, engineers, and emerging technology sectors. • Enhance digital presence by optimising the website, improving SEO, and increasing structured content creation. • Clarify and strengthen membership benefits by defining exclusive resources, networking opportunities, and professional development pathways. • Increase sponsorship and funding through structured partner programs and expanded corporate engagement. • Improve event strategy by introducing hybrid and fully virtual events, while ensuring better national coordination. • Adapt to AI and automation trends by integrating relevant topics into education programs and member discussions. • Monitor global risks (economic shifts, regulatory changes, and crises) and develop contingency strategies to ensure operational resilience.

  Marketing audit, strategy and actions The marketing audit and strategy have been developed based on extensive research conducted during the Marketing Action Plan development. This strategy is tailored to IESANZ, ensuring that it remains a leading authority in the lighting industry while addressing key areas for improvement, including branding consistency, digital presence, and communication strategies. The proposed actions aim to modernise the brand, enhance member engagement, and strengthen IESANZ’s position within the industry. Branding and positioning  Audit  Logo 
The IESANZ logo holds significant historical recognition within the industry, but a modern refresh would improve its alignment with the organisation’s mission and future direction. A contemporary update could include enhanced vibrancy by incorporating prism colours or emphasising the existing green palette to reflect energy, sustainability, and innovation. Additionally, subtle refinements, such as a prism starburst or sleek typography, could add a modern feel while preserving the logo’s legacy. Including "ANZ" within the logo would also reinforce the organisation’s regional identity, ensuring clear representation of its Australia and New Zealand focus.  Tag Line  The tagline, “The Lighting Society,” effectively broadens IESANZ’s appeal beyond its engineering origins, making it more accessible to a diverse range of professionals, including interior designers, architects, and researchers. Prioritising this tagline in branding and marketing 

IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 27 
  communications will reduce barriers for non-engineering professionals and reinforce IESANZ’s role as an inclusive, multidisciplinary lighting association.  Style guide The Corporate Identity Manual, last updated in 2006, lacks consistency in application across communication platforms and marketing materials. The updated journal design serves as a strong foundation for a modernised brand style guide that will establish a cohesive visual identity. This guide should define consistent brand elements, including colour palettes, typography, graphic styles, and tone of voice. Additionally, it should provide templates for digital and print materials, covering social media, email communications, presentations, and event branding. Ensuring that all IESANZ chapters follow these guidelines will strengthen brand consistency and recognition across regions.

IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 32 
  Corporate assets  Audit The current IESANZ corporate materials are functional and aligned with corporate guidelines but lack vibrancy and engagement, particularly for attracting younger professionals, women, and diverse audiences. While the materials are comprehensive and technically detailed, they primarily cater to lighting professionals and may not resonate with adjacent industries such as interior design, architecture, and sustainability sectors. Additionally, the design and tone feel outdated, with minimal use of visual storytelling, interactive elements, or modern content formats that could make the materials more engaging and accessible. Many assets remain static and text-heavy, limiting their effectiveness in communicating complex ideas in a clear and visually appealing manner. To enhance engagement, IESANZ must ensure that its corporate materials reflect the modern and dynamic nature of the lighting industry. Incorporating more visual, digital, and interactive elements will help maintain professionalism while improving accessibility and engagement across different audience segments.  Strategy To modernise and improve the appeal of its corporate assets, IESANZ should refresh its design approach, making materials more visually engaging, user-friendly, and accessible to a wider audience. While maintaining technical accuracy, updates should include infographics, dynamic layouts, and approachable language to enhance clarity and readability across different user groups. Aligning all updates with an updated brand style guide will ensure consistency in branding, messaging, and design across all corporate materials. A more cohesive and structured visual identity will enhance brand recognition and professionalism. To enhance digital accessibility, IESANZ should explore digital-first formats such as interactive PDFs, online portals, and visually engaging slide decks that provide a more interactive and engaging experience for modern users. Additionally, incorporating success stories, case studies, and member testimonials will add authenticity and relatability, making IESANZ’s content more compelling and widely appealing. To strengthen brand presence, the introduction of branded merchandise such as pins, pens, notebooks, and event giveaways can increase brand recognition at industry events, conferences, and networking sessions, reinforcing brand visibility and engagement with key stakeholders.  Corporate asset actions • Modernise the design and tone of corporate materials to enhance vibrancy, engagement, and readability, incorporating infographics, dynamic layouts, and an approachable language. 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 33 
  • Ensure all updated materials align with the refreshed brand style guide to maintain visual consistency and messaging alignment across all platforms. • Explore digital-first formats, including interactive PDFs, online portals, and visually engaging slide decks, to improve accessibility and engagement. • Develop new content formats, such as success stories, case studies, and testimonials, to add authenticity and attract a more diverse audience. • Introduce branded merchandise (e.g., pins, pens, notebooks, and event giveaways) to increase physical presence and brand visibility at industry events. • Conduct an audit of existing corporate materials to identify gaps and opportunities for modernisation, ensuring alignment with branding, industry trends, and audience expectations. 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 34 
  Public relations (PR) and thought leadership Audit IESANZ has minimal exposure for thought leadership outside of its existing channels, including the journal, website, and social media platforms. While these channels provide value, they do not fully capitalise on opportunities to extend IESANZ’s industry influence beyond its existing audience. There is limited presence in external media, industry publications, and conferences, reducing visibility and engagement with broader industry stakeholders. Currently, IESANZ lacks a proactive PR and media strategy to position its leaders, members, and key initiatives as authoritative voices in the lighting industry. There is also no structured approach to securing external speaking engagements, guest articles, or media opportunities, which could further elevate IESANZ’s reputation and influence across adjacent industries. By expanding PR efforts and leveraging external media, industry partnerships, and expert commentary, IESANZ could establish itself as a leading voice in lighting, sustainability, and technological advancements, attracting new members, stakeholders, and industry collaborations.  Strategy To enhance industry influence and external visibility, IESANZ should develop a structured PR and thought leadership strategy that extends beyond its internal channels. This includes proactively securing media placements, guest articles, and speaking opportunities at industry conferences and events. Key representatives should be positioned as go-to experts for industry commentary, strengthening IESANZ’s credibility and expanding reach. A targeted PR plan should be developed to engage with lighting, design, sustainability, and engineering publications, ensuring IESANZ’s thought leadership is featured in industry-relevant media. Additionally, forming strategic partnerships with aligned organisations and collaborating on joint industry reports, research papers, and advocacy initiatives will enhance credibility and reinforce IESANZ’s position as a progressive thought leader. IESANZ should also explore earned media opportunities by leveraging industry trends, regulatory changes, and technological advancements to generate timely expert insights. Establishing a media spokesperson program with designated experts prepared to comment on key industry topics will further strengthen IESANZ’s external credibility and media presence. To support these efforts, IESANZ should actively pitch guest articles and technical pieces to leading industry publications and business press, reinforcing expertise in lighting innovation, sustainability, and industry standards. A speaking engagement strategy should also be developed to ensure IESANZ representatives secure high-value presentation slots at industry events, further amplifying reach and visibility. By taking a proactive, multi-channel approach to PR and thought leadership, IESANZ can increase industry recognition, influence decision-makers, and attract new members, positioning itself as an indispensable authority in the lighting sector.  
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 35 
  PR and thought leadership actions • Develop a structured PR strategy that includes securing guest articles, expert commentary, and media interviews to expand IESANZ's external visibility. • Proactively pitch IESANZ leaders and industry experts for interviews and commentary in relevant trade publications, business media, and news outlets. • Secure speaking engagements at major industry events and conferences, ensuring IESANZ's presence as a leading voice in lighting, sustainability, and innovation. • Develop a media spokesperson program, identifying and preparing key representatives to comment on industry trends, policies, and technological advancements. • Leverage strategic partnerships to co-author industry reports, advocacy papers, and research projects, strengthening credibility and industry influence. • Create a targeted media outreach plan, engaging with lighting, design, engineering, and sustainability publications to position IESANZ as an industry thought leader. • Launch an earned media initiative, leveraging regulatory updates, emerging technologies, and industry trends to secure media placements. • Expand content distribution beyond internal channels, ensuring IESANZ's expertise reaches wider audiences through external industry platforms and media. • Position IESANZ as an advocate for industry best practices by engaging in key public policy debates and discussions. • Create content, including blog posts, articles, or reports, highlighting IESANZ’s stance on relevant public policy issues affecting the industry. • Develop and host industry roundtables or webinars to discuss public policy and sustainability initiatives. • Partner with industry stakeholders, government bodies, and educational institutions to advocate for key legislative and regulatory changes beneficial to the sector. • Launch a 100-Year Anniversary Campaign to celebrate IESANZ’s legacy and its impact on the lighting industry.   
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 36 
  Internal awards  Audit The IESANZ Awards program is a prestigious platform for industry recognition, but several barriers limit participation. The entry process is restrictive, requiring non-members to request access via email instead of submitting directly through the website, creating unnecessary friction. Additionally, the $400 AUD/NZD + GST entry fee may discourage participation, particularly among architects and designers who are not already engaged with IESANZ. While members can enter more easily, there is no clear incentive for them to do so. The awards are presented at a formal dinner during the annual conference, yet post-event promotion is minimal. Winners are listed on the website, but there is little supporting content, such as case studies, project insights, or interviews, which limits the visibility and ongoing impact of the awards beyond the event itself. Marketing efforts primarily rely on the IESANZ website, social media, and email, but there is no structured campaign to actively drive entries or showcase past winners. The awards tend to attract lighting suppliers, many of whom are sponsors, while participation from architects, interior designers, and emerging professionals remains low. The program lacks clear messaging around its broader industry value, beyond recognition, making it difficult to expand engagement outside the existing membership base.  Strategy To increase engagement and participation, IESANZ should enhance accessibility by developing an integrated online entry portal, allowing both members and non-members to submit entries easily. A tiered pricing structure should be introduced, offering discounted entry fees for members to encourage membership growth while still maintaining an entry fee for non-members. The benefits of entering the awards, including industry exposure, credibility, networking opportunities, and recognition, should be clearly communicated to attract a more diverse range of participants. Post-event visibility should also be significantly improved by introducing dedicated case studies, interviews, and winner showcases that provide ongoing value and strengthen long-term engagement. The awards website should feature structured content, including high-quality imagery, detailed project insights, and success stories, transforming it into a lasting industry resource rather than just a listing of winners. Marketing efforts should expand beyond IESANZ’s current channels and include targeted outreach to architects, designers, and emerging professionals, as well as strategic industry partnerships and structured social media campaigns to generate wider interest throughout the awards cycle.  Industry awards actions  • Develop an integrated online entry portal to allow both members and non-members to submit entries seamlessly. 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 37 
  • Implement a tiered pricing structure, providing discounted entry fees for members as an incentive for membership growth. • Improve communication around the benefits of entering the awards, highlighting industry exposure, credibility, and networking opportunities. • Expand marketing efforts through structured campaigns across social media, email newsletters, and industry partnerships to drive engagement. • Develop and showcase case studies, interviews, and in-depth project features for award winners to increase visibility and inspire future entrants. • Enhance the awards website with high-quality imagery, structured content, and project insights to transform it into a valuable industry resource. • Increase outreach efforts to architects, interior designers, and emerging professionals, ensuring broader participation in the awards. • Implement an ambassador program where active members advocate for IESANZ at industry events, conferences, and online discussions.   
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 38 
  Commissionable experiences Audit IESANZ has a strong foundation of chapter-led webinars and events, providing valuable regional engagement. However, the current structure is fragmented, with individual chapters managing their own events independently, leading to inconsistencies in quality, accessibility, and branding across the organisation. There is an opportunity to centralise and expand digital offerings by developing a unified platform to standardise content delivery and enhance the overall member experience. A centralised system would ensure that all members, regardless of location, have equal access to high-quality educational content. Additionally, IESANZ could introduce exclusive webinars and training sessions that remain free for members but accessible to non-members for a fee. This approach would not only generate additional revenue but also provide non-members with a preview of the benefits of joining. Strengthening the digital experience would further position IESANZ as a leading provider of industry education, attract new members, and enhance the overall value of membership.  Strategy To optimise its digital offerings, IESANZ should develop a centralised platform that serves as a hub for webinars, training, and educational resources. By consolidating these offerings into a single platform, IESANZ can ensure consistent content quality, branding, and accessibility across all chapters. This will create a seamless digital experience for members, eliminating the inconsistencies that currently exist due to decentralised event management. To enhance engagement and drive membership growth, IESANZ should introduce a tiered access model, where members continue to receive free access to webinars and training, while non-members pay a fee for select content. This approach allows non-members to experience the value of IESANZ’s educational offerings, increasing the likelihood of them joining as full members. To further strengthen the program, webinar content should focus on key industry trends, technological advancements, sustainability practices, and professional development opportunities, ensuring the content remains highly relevant and valuable to industry professionals. Expanding beyond its current marketing approach, IESANZ should implement targeted promotional efforts to raise awareness of these digital offerings. This includes leveraging social media campaigns, industry partnerships, and email marketing to increase visibility and engagement. Additionally, featuring case studies, expert interviews, and member testimonials as part of the educational content can enhance credibility and attract a broader audience. To ensure ongoing success, IESANZ must also commit to regularly evaluating and updating its digital offerings. By consistently refining content, adopting new formats, and staying aligned with industry developments, IESANZ can maintain its position as a leading industry educator, provide continued value to its members, and create a sustainable revenue stream from non-member participation. 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 39 
   Commissionable experiences actions • Develop a centralised digital platform to house all webinars, events, and educational resources in one easily accessible location. • Standardise webinar and event content to ensure consistent branding, quality, and delivery across all chapters. • Introduce fee-based webinars and training sessions for non-members, while keeping access free for members. • Market exclusive educational content to highlight industry trends, emerging technologies, and professional development opportunities. • Create a membership promotion strategy that showcases the value of IESANZ membership by leveraging exclusive access to industry-leading content. • Regularly evaluate and update digital offerings to ensure they remain engaging, relevant, and beneficial for both current and prospective members.   
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 40 
  Traditional marketing  Audit The traditional marketing efforts of IESANZ are underutilised, with limited use of white papers, logo placement in universities and other educational institutions, and corporate member sponsorships. While some traditional methods such as TV, radio, and billboards may not be relevant for IESANZ, there is significant potential to refine and expand strategic marketing initiatives. One key opportunity is advertising in universities and industry exhibitions, which could be an effective way to attract younger professionals, students, and individuals from adjacent fields such as architecture, interior design, and engineering. Strengthening brand presence in academic environments and lighting industry events would position IESANZ as a thought leader and career development platform for future industry professionals. Additionally, branded merchandise such as pins, pens, tote bags, and event giveaways could help increase brand visibility and foster a sense of belonging among members. While digital marketing remains a priority, traditional marketing should work in synergy with digital efforts to enhance IESANZ’s reach, reputation, and industry influence.  Strategy To effectively expand its reach through traditional marketing, IESANZ should focus on leveraging industry-relevant spaces and audiences through targeted partnerships and high-impact placements. A structured university outreach strategy could involve advertising in lighting-related courses, sponsoring educational events, or collaborating with academic institutions on industry projects. These efforts would increase awareness among students and emerging professionals, positioning IESANZ as a valuable resource for education and career progression. At industry exhibitions, IESANZ should enhance its presence by securing prominent logo placements, hosting branded booths, and distributing high-quality brochures that reinforce the organisation’s leadership in lighting. Providing branded merchandise at events and to members would further strengthen visibility, engagement, and long-term brand recall. To maximise reach, IESANZ should explore co-branded marketing initiatives with corporate members and sponsors, allowing the organisation to amplify its presence in key industry sectors. Additionally, a revamped annual journal could serve as a valuable marketing tool, offering insights, research, and industry updates while being distributed to sponsors, corporate members, and key stakeholders to enhance industry recognition. By integrating traditional marketing efforts with digital strategies, IESANZ can create a holistic and impactful approach, ensuring greater awareness, industry recognition, and member engagement.   
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 41 
  Traditional advertising actions • Identify and establish advertising opportunities in universities, educational institutions and relevant industry courses to attract students and emerging professionals. • Develop promotional materials such as brochures and white papers tailored for educational outreach and industry exhibitions. • Introduce branded merchandise (e.g., pins, pens, tote bags) for member engagement and event distribution. • Explore co-branded campaigns with corporate members and sponsors to amplify traditional marketing reach. • Revamp the IESANZ annual journal with an elevated design, PR, and communications strategy, ensuring wider distribution to sponsors, corporate members, and key stakeholders. • Monitor competitor activity in traditional marketing and adjust strategies to differentiate IESANZ’s messaging and industry positioning. • Evaluate the success of traditional marketing initiatives and refine strategies to ensure alignment with IESANZ’s overall branding and engagement goals.    
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 42 
  Sponsorships Audit IESANZ primarily relies on internal sponsorships from corporate members and stakeholders to secure funding, fostering strong industry relationships. While this approach provides stability, expanding into external sponsorship opportunities could significantly enhance IESANZ’s brand visibility and position it as a prominent player within the broader lighting, design, and engineering communities. Sponsoring external industry events, academic initiatives, or sustainability projects would increase exposure, attract new members and stakeholders, and reinforce IESANZ’s commitment to education, innovation, and sustainability. However, allocating funds for external sponsorships must be carefully justified to ensure that it delivers measurable value to members and aligns with IESANZ’s long-term goals. Additionally, managing perceptions is essential to ensure external sponsorships do not conflict with the interests of internal corporate sponsors or diminish the value of their contributions. A structured sponsorship strategy will allow IESANZ to balance internal and external sponsorship initiatives, ensuring sustainable funding while strengthening industry influence.  Strategy IESANZ should approach external sponsorship as a strategic tool for brand building, targeting high-impact events and initiatives that align with its mission and objectives. Opportunities could include sponsoring industry exhibitions, academic conferences, sustainability projects, or innovation-driven initiatives, all of which would increase brand credibility and attract new members and key stakeholders. A structured sponsorship framework should be developed to evaluate external opportunities based on their alignment with IESANZ’s values and measurable outcomes, such as membership growth, industry influence, and brand recognition. IESANZ should also explore co-sponsorship opportunities with internal sponsors, ensuring that external sponsorship initiatives do not diminish their contributions but rather enhance mutual benefits. To enhance the value proposition for internal corporate sponsors, IESANZ should introduce expanded sponsorship packages, offering additional benefits such as discounted sponsorship tiers, education opportunities, and premium brand visibility at IESANZ-hosted events. Regular assessments should be conducted to review the effectiveness of sponsorship initiatives, ensuring they align with IESANZ’s broader goals while delivering tangible benefits to members, sponsors, and stakeholders. By taking a balanced and strategic approach, IESANZ can strengthen its position as a collaborative leader in the lighting industry, effectively leveraging both internal and external sponsorships to drive brand influence, financial sustainability, and long-term industry impact.  Sponsorship and association actions • Evaluate external sponsorship opportunities based on alignment with IESANZ’s mission, objectives, and ability to enhance industry standing. 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 43 
  • Prioritise sponsorship of high-impact events that showcase IESANZ’s commitment to education, innovation, and sustainability, such as academic conferences, exhibitions, or awards programs. • Clearly communicate the benefits of external sponsorship to internal sponsors, demonstrating how it enhances IESANZ’s profile and provides indirect benefits to corporate members and stakeholders. • Develop a structured sponsorship framework to ensure funds are allocated strategically, with measurable outcomes tied to membership growth, brand recognition, and industry influence. • Explore co-sponsorship opportunities with internal sponsors for external events, fostering collaborative partnerships that benefit all parties. • Regularly review and assess the impact of external sponsorship activities to ensure they deliver value, remain aligned with IESANZ’s broader goals, and continue to enhance industry reputation. • Expand sponsorship opportunities for corporate members, including discounted sponsorship tiers, premium visibility, and education-focused sponsorship packages.  
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 44 
  Business, consumer events and trade show attendance Audit IESANZ's participation in events and trade shows has primarily been managed at the chapter level, resulting in limited association-wide visibility and impact. While local chapters engage in regional events, these efforts lack a cohesive national or trans-Tasman strategy, leading to inconsistent representation and missed opportunities for industry leadership. This fragmented approach restricts IESANZ’s ability to establish itself as a leading authority in lighting and limits engagement with complementary sectors such as interior design, architecture, sustainability, and engineering. Additionally, IESANZ has not fully capitalised on thought leadership opportunities, including presentations, panel discussions, or workshops at major industry events and trade shows. Without a structured strategy, IESANZ risks missing key networking, sponsorship, and collaboration opportunities that could expand its influence across the industry.  Strategy To position IESANZ as a recognised leader and expand its industry influence, the association should adopt a proactive and strategic approach to event participation. A cohesive national event strategy should be developed to align with IESANZ’s goals of industry growth, member engagement, and cross-sector collaboration. A curated event calendar, incorporating high-value trade shows, consumer expos, and professional conferences, will enable IESANZ to establish a stronger national and trans-Tasman presence. Active participation in major events should include speaking engagements, panel discussions, and technical workshops, positioning IESANZ as a thought leader in sustainability, lighting standards, and human-centric lighting. To ensure effective representation, IESANZ should coordinate branding, messaging, and objectives across all events, ensuring local chapter expertise aligns with a unified national strategy. A dedicated budget for event participation will help fund travel, exhibition booths, promotional materials, and member engagement efforts. Additionally, partnerships with event organisers should be explored to secure sponsorships, co-branded sessions, and exclusive speaking opportunities, further enhancing IESANZ’s visibility and credibility. Regular evaluation of event participation should be conducted, using metrics such as membership inquiries, stakeholder engagement, media exposure, and sponsorship interest to assess return on investment (ROI) and refine future strategies. By adopting a structured and strategic approach, IESANZ can maximise the value of its event participation, build stronger industry partnerships, and expand its influence across multiple sectors.  Business, consumer events and trade show attendance actions • Conduct a review of past event participation to identify successful strategies and missed opportunities. 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 45 
  • Develop a national event calendar, prioritising high-value industry events, trade shows, and conferences with cross-industry relevance (e.g., architecture, interior design, engineering, and sustainability). • Position IESANZ as a thought leader by securing speaking engagements, workshops, and panel discussions at major industry events and trade shows. • Collaborate with chapters to ensure consistent branding, messaging, and objectives across all events, maintaining a nationally unified presence. • Allocate a dedicated budget for event participation to support travel, exhibition booths, promotional materials, and member engagement efforts. • Partner with event organisers to secure sponsorships, co-branded sessions, and speaking opportunities, expanding IESANZ’s influence and visibility. • Regularly evaluate event ROI, measuring membership inquiries, stakeholder engagement, and media exposure, to refine and optimise future event strategies.    
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 46 
  Customer service Audit The current member service experience for IESANZ has significant gaps that could impact member satisfaction, retention, and overall growth. A membership inquiry submitted via the website has gone unanswered for over three weeks, highlighting delays in response times and follow-up processes. Additionally, new membership applications have remained unprocessed for extended periods, suggesting inefficiencies in the approval and onboarding system. These delays can discourage prospective members from joining and create frustration among existing members who require support and information. Issues also extend to social media engagement, with queries submitted through platforms such as Facebook’s Meta Suite remaining unanswered. This suggests that social media inquiries are not actively monitored or prioritised, despite these platforms being key engagement channels—particularly for younger demographics that IESANZ aims to attract. Neglecting social media engagement creates the perception of inaccessibility and results in missed opportunities to interact with current and potential members. Beyond just response times, the tone and professionalism of communication play a crucial role. Every customer service interaction should be welcoming, solution-focused, and professional, reinforcing IESANZ’s position as an engaged, responsive, and supportive organisation.  Strategy IESANZ must improve response times, efficiency, and consistency across all customer service channels to create a positive and seamless member experience. A structured inquiry management system should be introduced to ensure that website, email, and social media queries are acknowledged and actioned within a set timeframe. To establish clear expectations, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) should be implemented, defining specific response time commitments, such as acknowledging all inquiries within 24 to 48 hours and resolving them as quickly as possible. The membership approval process should also be streamlined, ensuring that new applicants receive timely updates on their status. The introduction of automated confirmation emails upon application submission, along with regular status updates, will help reduce frustration and improve the onboarding experience for new members. To address social media engagement gaps, a dedicated team member should be assigned to monitor and respond to messages daily. This will enhance IESANZ’s visibility, responsiveness, and accessibility, particularly among younger professionals who rely on social media for communication. In addition to improving response times, the tone of communication must align with IESANZ’s brand—ensuring that all interactions are professional, approachable, and solution-driven. To maintain consistent messaging standards, IESANZ should develop communication guidelines and provide customer service training to staff responsible for handling member inquiries. Regular reviews of response times and customer service processes should also be conducted to identify areas for improvement and ensure ongoing efficiency.  
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 47 
  By implementing these strategic changes, IESANZ can create a highly responsive and member-focused service experience, strengthening engagement, satisfaction, and overall industry reputation.  Customer service actions • Introduce a structured inquiry management system to ensure website, email, and social media queries are responded to within a clear timeframe. • Establish a Service Level Agreement (SLA) to define clear response time expectations, with acknowledgment of inquiries within 24 to 48 hours and timely resolutions. • Streamline the membership approval process, introducing automated confirmation emails and regular status updates to improve onboarding efficiency. • Assign a team member to monitor social media inquiries daily, ensuring timely and proactive engagement with members and potential members. • Develop communication guidelines to ensure that all member interactions are professional, welcoming, and solution focused. • Provide customer service training for staff handling inquiries to maintain a high standard of service and consistency. • Regularly review response times and customer service processes, using member feedback and analytics to identify areas for improvement and enhance service delivery.     
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 48 
  Conference and events Audit The IESANZ conference is a key industry event that brings together lighting professionals, engineers, and designers for knowledge sharing, networking, and professional development. While the event is well-regarded, a comprehensive review of its communication, marketing, branding, and member engagement strategies is needed to ensure continued growth, relevance, and attendee engagement. One key limitation is the lack of readily available conference materials, making it difficult to assess their effectiveness in attracting attendees and maintaining consistency in branding and messaging. The current program is extensive but primarily focuses on lighting showcases and technical presentations, which, while valuable, may limit engagement from adjacent industries such as architecture, interior design, and sustainability sectors. Additionally, the format lacks diverse educational components, such as interactive workshops, hands-on demonstrations, and roundtable discussions, which could increase audience participation and broaden appeal. Networking opportunities are largely structured around formal sessions and the awards dinner, leaving room for expansion. Introducing informal networking events such as breakfast meetups, roundtable discussions, and casual social gatherings would help strengthen professional relationships and foster greater industry collaboration. Another critical limitation is that the current in-person format restricts accessibility for those unable to attend due to travel or scheduling conflicts. Introducing hybrid or digital participation options could expand reach, making the conference more inclusive and adaptable to the needs of a broader audience.  Strategy To enhance the IESANZ conference and ensure continued industry relevance, a comprehensive review of past events should be conducted. This should assess marketing effectiveness, branding consistency, and attendee engagement, helping to identify areas for improvement and opportunities for expansion. Future conferences should focus on broadening their appeal by incorporating diverse themes, workshops, and a wider range of speakers, particularly from adjacent fields such as architecture, design, sustainability, and smart technology. This would position the conference as a multidisciplinary platform, attracting a wider professional audience while reinforcing IESANZ’s role as a thought leader. To improve accessibility and reduce environmental impact, IESANZ should adopt a digital-first approach to the conference program, making materials available online rather than relying heavily on printed brochures. Additionally, hybrid or virtual participation options should be introduced to allow members who cannot attend in person to engage remotely. Expanding networking opportunities is also essential. Implementing informal networking sessions, such as breakfast gatherings, panel Q&A discussions, and structured social meetups, would help enhance industry connections beyond formal sessions. Ensuring that branding remains consistent across all conference materials and promotional assets will also help reinforce the association’s identity and increase event recognition.

   By enhancing accessibility, diversifying content, and expanding networking opportunities, IESANZ can strengthen its conference as a premier event in the lighting industry, increasing engagement from both current and new members.  Conference and event actions • Conduct a full review of past conferences to assess marketing effectiveness, branding consistency, and attendee engagement. • Explore program enhancements, including a wider range of speakers, workshops, and interactive learning sessions to broaden industry appeal. • Implement a digital-first approach for the conference program to reduce printing costs, improve accessibility, and align with sustainability initiatives. • Investigate hybrid or digital participation options to allow remote attendees to engage and expand the event's reach. • Introduce additional networking opportunities, such as breakfast meetups, panel discussions, and informal social gatherings to enhance professional connections. • Ensure consistent branding across all conference materials and promotional assets to reinforce IESANZ's industry identity and strengthen brand recognition. • Host lighting innovation hackathons where professionals, students, and industry leaders come together to solve industry challenges or develop new lighting solutions. • Design a physical or virtual escape room experience where teams of professionals solve lighting-related puzzles or challenges, such as designing sustainable lighting solutions for different environments or troubleshooting lighting issues in a fictional city.

  Digital media Website Audit The IESANZ website has a solid foundation, with clear navigation, a clean design, and consistent branding. However, several issues undermine its effectiveness, user experience, and engagement. The website design appears outdated, lacking modern visuals, interactive features, and engaging content, which reduces its appeal to both current and prospective members. Additionally, content is not updated regularly, with limited refreshes to webinars, educational resources, and event listings, making it less valuable as an industry hub. Spelling and grammar inconsistencies further diminish professionalism and credibility. Technical issues are also negatively impacting usability. The site contains 227 broken links and over 100 duplicate or missing meta descriptions and title tags, which harm SEO performance and search visibility. The mobile experience is significantly less effective than the desktop version, with poor navigation, slow load times (4.8 seconds), and un-optimised images, leading to a subpar experience for mobile users. Additionally, the website footer contains outdated elements, including a non-functional “Online Store” link, creating unnecessary user friction. The use of generic stock imagery also fails to reflect the IESANZ brand, mission, and industry identity, further detracting from the website’s visual appeal and engagement.

IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 53 
    Strategy To modernise the website and enhance engagement, IESANZ should prioritise a website redesign that incorporates a visually appealing, intuitive, and mobile-optimised user interface. A refreshed site with high-quality, brand-aligned images, formatted for web performance (e.g., WebP or AVIF), will significantly improve the browsing experience. A structured content strategy should be implemented to regularly update webinars, educational resources, industry news, and member-exclusive content. The homepage should prominently highlight key membership benefits using clear, engaging calls-to-action (CTAs) to attract new members and encourage engagement. Addressing technical issues is critical for improving both usability and SEO performance. Fixing broken links, missing metadata, and duplicate title tags will enhance search rankings and ensure a seamless user experience. The mobile interface must also be fully optimised, ensuring smooth navigation, faster load times, and a responsive design that adapts to various devices. To further increase engagement, interactive elements such as pop-ups, banners, or live chat features should be introduced to promote membership opportunities, industry events, and professional development programs. Additionally, removing outdated elements like the non-functional “Online Store” link or ensuring its functionality will create a cleaner, more user-friendly experience.  IESANZ should enhance it by implementing these improvements, IESANZ will enhance its digital presence, strengthen industry reputation, and create a more engaging and valuable online hub for members and prospective audiences.  Website actions • Redesign the website with a modern, visually appealing, and user-friendly interface. • Replace outdated stock imagery with high-quality, brand-aligned visuals, optimised for web performance (e.g., WebP or AVIF). • Develop a structured content strategy, aligned with the event calendar, to ensure regular updates for webinars, educational resources, and industry news. • Highlight key membership benefits on the homepage using clear, engaging CTAs to attract and retain members. • Resolve technical issues, including fixing 227 broken links and addressing over 100 duplicate or missing meta descriptions and title tags. • Optimise the mobile interface to improve navigation, address slow load times, and enhance user experience across all devices. • Remove outdated elements, such as the non-functional "Online Store” link, or ensure it is fully operational. • Incorporate interactive features such as pop-ups, banners, or live chat to promote membership opportunities, industry events, and educational programs. 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 54 
  • Standardise spelling and grammar across all pages to improve professionalism and credibility. • Audit and update existing pages to ensure content accuracy and alignment with IESANZ’s mission and branding. • Establish a performance tracking system to monitor visitor traffic, bounce rates, and membership conversion rates, ensuring continuous improvements based on user data.

  Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) content On-site SEO Audit The SEO performance of the IESANZ website reveals critical areas requiring improvement, significantly impacting search rankings, visibility, and user experience. While the site health score is 74%, it falls behind the industry benchmark of 92% for high-performing websites. Several technical issues are affecting search engine crawlability and indexing, including 227 broken internal links and 11 4xx error pages, which create a poor user experience and prevent search engines from properly ranking the site. Additionally, 107 pages are missing meta descriptions, and 102 pages contain duplicate H1 and title tags, making it difficult for search engines to determine page relevance and reducing overall discoverability. Another significant issue is the low word count on 37 pages, where content falls below 200 words, sending negative quality signals to search engines. Technical inefficiencies also hinder performance, particularly slow load times (4.8 seconds on average for mobile users) due to large JavaScript and CSS files, un-optimised images, and blocked internal resources. These factors contribute to poor Core Web Vitals performance, currently at 0%, which is now a critical ranking factor for search engines like Google. Visual and structural issues further compound SEO challenges. Two images lack alt attributes, making them inaccessible for search engine indexing, and many images are not optimised for web use, which slows page speed and negatively affects ranking potential. The text-to-HTML ratio is too low on 81 pages, meaning there is too much code relative to actual content, making it harder for search engines to interpret page relevance. Despite these challenges, the website benefits from existing backlinks, which help establish domain authority. However, the overall SEO strategy remains weak due to inconsistent metadata, poor mobile optimisation, and a lack of a structured content approach, preventing IESANZ from achieving competitive search rankings.

IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 57 
    Type of Issues Number of issues About the issue Internal broken links 227 Broken internal links redirect users to non-existent pages, diminishing their user experience and potentially harming your search engine rankings. No meta descriptions 107 Meta descriptions are displayed in search results as your page description. If your page's meta description tag is missing, search engines will usually display its first sentence, which may be irrelevant and unappealing to users. Large JavaScript and CSS files 107 Minimising JavaScript and CSS files makes their size smaller, thereby decreasing your page load time, providing a better user experience and improving your search engine rankings. 4xx error pages 11 A 4xx error means that a webpage cannot be accessed. This is usually the result of broken links. These errors can negatively affect both user experience and search engine crawlability. Duplicate H1 and title tags 102 Duplicate tags make it difficult for search engines to determine which of a website's pages is relevant for a specific search query, which means the chance of a higher ranking is low and the page might be at risk of being banned. Low text-HTML ratio 81 Text to HTML ratio indicates the amount of actual text you have on your webpage compared to the amount of code. This issue is triggered when your text to HTML is 10% or less. Search engines have begun focusing on pages that contain more content, so a lower ratio would indicate low ranking in search results. Blocked internal resources 38 Blocked resources are JavaScript, image files etc that are blocked from crawling. This prevents search engines from accessing them and, as a result, properly rendering and indexing your webpages, resulting in low SEO ranking. Low word count 37 This means the number of words on your webpage is less than 200, which impacts the quality signal to search engines. HTTPS pages lead to HTTP pages 2 If any link on website points to the old HTTP version of website, search engines can become confused as to which version of the page they should rank. No alt attributes 2 Alt attributes are used by search engines to understand the contents of your images. Neglected alt attributes may result in a lower chance of ranking on image search queries.   
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 58 
  Strategy To improve SEO performance, IESANZ must implement a structured optimisation strategy focused on content improvements, technical fixes, and ongoing monitoring. Meta titles and descriptions should be created or updated for all 107 missing pages, ensuring they are unique, keyword-rich, and compelling to attract clicks. Duplicate H1 and title tags must be eliminated to avoid confusing search engines and enhance page relevance. Pages with low word counts should be enriched with valuable, well-researched content, incorporating H2 and H3 headings, bullet points, and keyword optimisation to improve searchability and readability. On the technical side, fixing 227 broken links and 11 4xx error pages is essential to improve crawlability and eliminate navigation dead ends. Minimising JavaScript and CSS file sizes will enhance page speed, particularly for mobile users, where slow load times are a significant ranking disadvantage. Improving Core Web Vitals metrics, such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and First Input Delay (FID), will align with modern SEO standards, improving search rankings and user engagement. Updating outdated HTTP links to HTTPS is also necessary for secure and consistent indexing. The website’s visual content and accessibility must also be improved. All images should include descriptive alt attributes, and filenames should be renamed using relevant keywords to boost image search rankings. Compressing and resizing images will reduce load times while maintaining visual quality. Addressing the low text-to-HTML ratio will ensure a better balance between code and meaningful content, making pages more readable and rank-worthy. Strengthening internal linking will distribute authority across the site, guiding search engines through hierarchical page relationships and improving navigation for users. Additionally, securing high-quality backlinks from industry-relevant websites will bolster domain authority and boost organic search visibility. To ensure ongoing SEO success, IESANZ must conduct regular audits, monitor keyword performance, and track ranking improvements. By implementing this comprehensive SEO strategy, IESANZ will enhance its digital presence, improve search rankings, and attract greater engagement from industry professionals and potential members.  Google Business Presence Audit IESANZ and its regional chapters do not currently have Google Business Pages, which limits their visibility in search results and local discovery. Without these listings, prospective members, partners, and industry stakeholders may find it difficult to access key information, including upcoming events, membership benefits, and contact details. The absence of Google Business listings also means IESANZ is missing out on a valuable SEO opportunity, as search engines prioritise verified business listings for relevant industry searches. Additionally, without a maintained Google presence, the organisation is less likely to appear in local search results when professionals look for industry associations or networking opportunities in their area.  
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 59 
  Strategy IESANZ should establish and maintain Google Business Pages for both the main association and its chapters to enhance search rankings, credibility, and local discoverability. These pages should be regularly updated with key information, including events, membership benefits, industry news, and educational opportunities. Member testimonials, professional development resources, and high-quality images from past events should be used to strengthen engagement and trust. Additionally, Google Business should be leveraged for posting announcements, event updates, and driving traffic to the website, reinforcing IESANZ as an active and valuable industry organisation.  SEO content actions • Fix critical SEO issues, including broken links, duplicate H1 tags, missing metadata, poor mobile optimisation, and excessive JavaScript/CSS file sizes. • Develop a structured SEO strategy focused on content quality, keyword optimisation, and improved internal linking. • Create and update meta titles and descriptions across 107 missing pages, ensuring keyword relevance and engagement. • Add alt attributes to all images, rename image files using SEO-friendly keywords, and compress images to optimise page load speeds. • Improve content depth on low-word-count pages, ensuring all pages provide valuable, structured, and keyword-optimised information. • Strengthen internal linking to enhance navigation and distribute ranking authority across site pages. • Obtain additional high-quality backlinks from industry-relevant websites to improve domain authority. • Resolve text-to-HTML ratio issues by ensuring more meaningful content and reducing excessive page code. • Monitor Core Web Vitals performance and improve load speeds and responsiveness. • Conduct routine SEO audits to track keyword performance, ranking improvements, and technical fixes. • Set up and verify Google Business Pages for IESANZ and its regional chapters. • Ensure business details (location, contact info, website links) are accurate and up to date. • Regularly post announcements, events, and industry news to enhance engagement. • Upload high-quality images from IESANZ events and initiatives. • Monitor and respond to reviews and inquiries to strengthen credibility.    
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 60 
  Search engine marketing (SEM) Audit IESANZ is not currently leveraging Search Engine Marketing (SEM), including Google Ads and other paid search strategies, to enhance its digital visibility and audience reach. Without a structured SEM approach, IESANZ relies solely on organic search, which limits its ability to compete effectively for search rankings, website traffic, and engagement. By not investing in paid search advertising, IESANZ is missing a key opportunity to increase awareness, attract new members, and promote industry events and educational offerings to a highly targeted audience.  Strategy To improve discoverability and drive conversions, IESANZ should implement a comprehensive SEM strategy focused on Google Ads and other paid search initiatives. Targeted campaigns should prioritise high-intent keywords related to lighting design, industry certification, professional development, and membership benefits to ensure that IESANZ appears prominently in search results. A data-driven approach should be used, incorporating A/B testing, audience segmentation, and conversion tracking to optimise performance over time. SEM campaigns should also be integrated with SEO efforts, ensuring that both paid and organic search strategies reinforce each other and maximise return on investment (ROI).  SEM actions • Develop a structured SEM strategy, leveraging Google Ads and other paid search platforms to drive membership sign-ups, event registrations, and engagement with educational content. • Conduct keyword research to identify and target high-performing industry-related search terms. • Implement paid search campaigns to increase website traffic, enhance visibility, and improve conversion rates for memberships and events. • Use audience segmentation and A/B testing to refine ad copy, targeting, and bidding strategies for optimal performance. • Apply conversion tracking to monitor lead generation, ad engagement, and overall campaign effectiveness. • Align SEM efforts with SEO initiatives to create a cohesive digital marketing strategy, improving both paid and organic search performance. • Regularly assess campaign performance and adjust SEM tactics based on analytics, industry trends, and engagement metrics. 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 61 
  eNewsletter and email direct marketing (eDM) Audit The eNewsletter templates have recently been redesigned to a modernised format, improving visual appeal, readability, and brand alignment compared to the previous version, which lacked engagement and impact. While this update enhances aesthetic appeal, the effectiveness of content strategy and delivery remains a key focus area. In email marketing, content is king, and sending emails without a clear purpose or value leads to unsubscribe fatigue and diminished engagement. Without high-value, relevant content, members are less likely to open emails, click through, or take action. A targeted, quality-over-quantity approach is essential to keep members engaged and reinforce IESANZ’s role as an authoritative industry body. Additionally, the eNewsletter should not only engage existing members but also serve as a tool to reach new audiences and attract new members. Currently, non-members have limited exposure to IESANZ’s content, and there is no clear email sign-up mechanism to capture potential new members. By implementing a public eNewsletter sign-up on the website, and introducing eNewsletter sign-up strategies at events, non-members can be nurtured through targeted email content, introducing them to the benefits of IESANZ membership. To maximise effectiveness, the eNewsletter must consistently deliver meaningful content, such as industry updates, professional insights, and educational opportunities, while avoiding excessive or redundant communication. Establishing a well-structured schedule with segmented, relevant messaging will ensure that members receive content that matters to them, improving retention and strengthening IESANZ’s brand presence and thought leadership.  Strategy 
 The eNewsletter should be optimised to act as both an engagement tool for existing members and a lead-generation tool for non-members. A modern, professional design should ensure alignment with IESANZ’s brand identity and other communication assets, such as the journal and  1 https://www.wethrift.com/p/email-marketing-statistics/ Key Performance Indicator Current Result Desired Result Industry Standard1 Open Rate 54.54%  Maintain at least 50% or higher 20-50% Click Thru Rate 2.26% 4% or higher 4.01% Unsubscribe Rate 0.08% Reduce to 0.05 or lower 0.01% 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 62 
  annual reports. The content strategy must focus on quality over quantity, ensuring each edition provides industry updates, professional development opportunities, and thought leadership insights. A structured and segmented email strategy will help avoid communication fatigue while maintaining consistent engagement. To achieve this, the eNewsletter should incorporate a mix of exclusive member content and publicly available insights, enticing non-members to explore the benefits of joining IESANZ. The inclusion of locked content, such as premium reports, exclusive case studies, and members-only webinars, will encourage non-members to sign up and eventually transition into full membership. To expand the reach of IESANZ beyond its existing membership base, a public sign-up option for non-members should be prominently displayed on the website, social media channels, and event pages. This feature will allow industry professionals, students, and potential sponsors to access teaser content, providing them with regular insights into IESANZ’s offerings. Additionally, email campaigns should be developed specifically for non-members, highlighting key benefits, showcasing member success stories, and offering exclusive previews of member-only content to drive conversions. Performance metrics, including open rates, click-through rates, and unsubscribe rates, should be closely monitored to identify trends, refine content, and ensure the eNewsletter remains effective. By integrating personalised content recommendations and segmenting subscriber lists, IESANZ can ensure that recipients receive information relevant to their industry and professional needs. This approach will not only enhance engagement but also position IESANZ as a go-to resource for lighting professionals while nurturing potential new members.  eDM actions • Redesign the eNewsletter content to align with IESANZ’s brand identity, creating a modern, engaging, and visually appealing format. • Develop a structured content strategy, prioritising industry updates, technical insights, educational opportunities, and advocacy news. • Maintain a consistent delivery schedule while ensuring targeted content for different member segments. • Introduce a "Sign Up for Updates" feature on the website and “Sign Up” campaigns at events, expos and tradeshows etc to capture email addresses from non-members, allowing them to receive regular insights and updates. • Implement locked premium content, requiring email sign-up to access exclusive industry reports, whitepapers, or webinars, encouraging non-members to engage with IESANZ’s content. • Create targeted email campaigns for non-members, highlighting key membership benefits, offering exclusive previews, and showcasing testimonials and case studies. • Use audience segmentation to personalise email content, ensuring that recipients receive relevant and meaningful communication. • Introduce interactive elements, such as polls, surveys, and Q&A features, to enhance engagement and gather member feedback. • Monitor key performance metrics, including open rates, click-through rates, and unsubscribe rates, using insights to refine content and improve retention. • Ensure all links and CTAs drive traffic to IESANZ’s website and membership pages, maximising conversion opportunities. 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 63 
   Digital content and experiences Audit IESANZ has a strong foundation of chapter-led webinars and events, providing valuable regional engagement. However, the current structure is fragmented, with individual chapters managing their own events independently. This decentralised approach results in inconsistencies in quality, accessibility, and branding, reducing the overall impact of digital learning opportunities. Additionally, IESANZ does not have a structured or visible plan for webinars or podcasts on its website. Without a centralised digital strategy, these valuable content formats remain underutilised, limiting engagement, industry influence, and non-member attraction. The absence of an IESANZ-branded podcast also represents a missed opportunity to expand thought leadership beyond traditional channels. There is an opportunity to centralise and expand digital offerings by developing a unified platform to standardise content delivery, improve accessibility, and enhance the overall member experience. A structured webinar and podcast strategy would establish IESANZ as a leading provider of industry education, offering exclusive content to members while attracting non-members through targeted engagement.  Strategy To strengthen its digital content strategy, IESANZ should develop a centralised platform that houses all webinars, training sessions, and educational resources in one easily accessible location. Consolidating these offerings ensures consistent quality, branding, and accessibility across all chapters. This structured approach will create a seamless digital experience for members while extending reach to non-members through strategic engagement. IESANZ should introduce a tiered access model where members continue to receive free access to webinars and training, while non-members pay a fee for select premium content. This provides a preview of IESANZ’s educational value, increasing the likelihood of conversion into full membership. Webinars should focus on key industry trends, technological advancements, sustainability practices, and professional development opportunities, ensuring ongoing relevance and value. Expanding beyond traditional formats, IESANZ should develop an official podcast to enhance thought leadership and extend industry influence beyond its member base. This podcast can feature expert interviews, technical discussions, and case studies, offering valuable insights to members while attracting external industry professionals. To increase visibility, IESANZ should implement targeted promotional efforts, including social media campaigns, industry partnerships, and email marketing to drive engagement. Leveraging Google Business Pages for IESANZ and its chapters will further boost searchability, improve credibility, and enhance the discoverability of educational offerings. 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 64 
  To ensure ongoing success, IESANZ must commit to regularly evaluating and updating its digital offerings. By consistently refining content, adopting new formats, and aligning with industry developments, IESANZ can strengthen its position as a leading industry educator while generating a sustainable revenue stream from non-member participation.  Digital content and experiences actions • Develop a centralised digital platform to house all webinars, events, and educational resources in one easily accessible location. • Standardise webinar and event content to ensure consistent branding, quality, and delivery across all chapters. • Introduce a fee-based model for non-members to access exclusive webinars, training sessions, and educational content, while maintaining free access for members. • Develop and launch an IESANZ-branded podcast, featuring expert discussions, industry insights, and member success stories to strengthen thought leadership. • Promote exclusive educational content through a targeted marketing strategy, highlighting key industry trends, emerging technologies, and professional development opportunities. • Create a membership conversion strategy that showcases the value of IESANZ membership, leveraging exclusive access to industry-leading content. • Establish and actively maintain Google Business Pages for IESANZ and its chapters to improve searchability and credibility. • Regularly evaluate and update digital offerings to ensure they remain engaging, relevant, and beneficial for both current and prospective members. • Empower members to create and share their own content on IESANZ’s digital platforms. • Create a "Virtual Lighting Lab", a platform where members can collaborate on solving industry problems or exploring lighting innovations. • Launch a forum or initiative focused on how lighting impacts urban planning, smart cities, and sustainability. • Develop a lighting history series, showcasing the evolution of lighting technologies and the pioneers in lighting design.

  Social media marketing Audit Platform review IESANZ maintains a presence across Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and YouTube, but engagement levels remain low, and content is inconsistent across platforms. The association lacks a unified content strategy, leading to missed opportunities for brand awareness, engagement, and membership growth. Platform review Post frequency Images Facebook  632 followers  The page has a modest following of 632 users, with a professional yet somewhat outdated brand presence. Content primarily consists of static event promotions and key association updates, often receiving little engagement, with most posts averaging between zero to three likes and no comments. The page lacks diverse content formats, such as video or interactive posts, which are critical for improving engagement. Community interaction is minimal, with no responses to user comments or reviews, creating a missed opportunity to foster relationships with members and potential new audiences.

  Platform review Post frequency Images LinkedIn  2k followers  IESANZ has a more substantial presence with 2,000 followers, but the platform remains severely underutilised. The page has only published two posts in the past year, preventing it from leveraging LinkedIn’s networking potential among professionals in the lighting industry. There is little content related to thought leadership, industry insights, or advocacy efforts, which could otherwise establish IESANZ as an authoritative voice in the sector. Additionally, the lack of interaction with industry discussions, partner organisations, and member posts further reduces its impact. 2 posts for the last year

Existing content consists of four long-form technical presentations, likely appealing only to a niche audience rather than a broader membership base. The channel’s branding is outdated, and the "About" section does not effectively communicate the organisation’s mission.

  Current social engagement and community management Engagement levels across all platforms are minimal, with posts receiving very few interactions, such as likes, comments, or shares. The lack of responses by IESANZ to user comments, reviews and recommendations indicates limited community management, which is a missed opportunity to foster stronger relationships with followers and demonstrate active involvement. Current posting activity  Posting activity is sporadic and lacks a strategic approach to consistently engage members or expand reach. To effectively support the community and attract new audiences, a structured content calendar and posting strategy should be implemented. Regular, purposeful and readily recognisable content can help solidify IESANZ's presence and relevance in the industry. Current Tone of voice  The tone of voice is consistent across platforms, however standardised tone should be established to align with IESANZ’s brand guidelines while ensuring it resonates with both current and potential members. Current hashtags / emojis used Emojis are consistently used in most posts, adding some personality to the content. However, their usage should be reviewed to ensure they remain professional and align with the overall brand identity. Hashtags, on the other hand, require further optimisation and should be tailored for each platform to maximise discoverability and engagement. A strategic review of hashtag usage is recommended to better utilise keywords, target relevant audiences and improve reach. Paid social media activity   Paid social media activity is currently non-existent across all platforms. Without paid advertising, IESANZ struggles to expand its reach, attract new members, or effectively promote key events and initiatives. Implementing a paid campaign strategy could significantly boost brand awareness, engagement, and event attendance by targeting specific demographics such as students, architects, interior designers, and corporate sponsors. Strategy Social media platform summary IESANZ’s social media presence spans across Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and YouTube, with varying levels of engagement and effectiveness. While LinkedIn has the largest following, overall engagement across all platforms remains low due to inconsistent content strategies, irregular posting, and limited interaction with followers. To reach a broader and younger audience, TikTok should be introduced as an experimental platform, capitalising on its rapid growth and potential to engage emerging professionals and students in the lighting industry.

IESANZ should prioritise timely responses to comments, messages, and mentions, ensuring that user interactions are acknowledged within 24-48 hours. Community-building efforts should include responding to comments, encouraging discussions, and recognising valuable contributions from followers. Interactive initiatives such as contests, Q&A sessions, and member-generated content campaigns should be implemented to strengthen relationships with both members and industry professionals. User-generated content, including member testimonials, photos, and industry insights, should be actively shared to foster a sense of belonging and encourage greater participation. To ensure consistency, a dedicated engagement schedule should be maintained, with at least three days per week allocated to community interaction and audience engagement. Paid social media activity  To maximise the potential of paid social media, IESANZ should adopt a targeted approach to engage both existing and prospective members. A targeted paid strategy is essential for expanding IESANZ’s reach, growing membership, and driving event participation. Paid campaigns should focus on increasing brand awareness, promoting professional development opportunities, and boosting engagement with events and webinars. A multi-segmented audience approach should be used, targeting different industry professionals, students, and potential sponsors with tailored messaging. Experimentation with different formats, including carousel ads, video campaigns, and lead generation forms, will ensure content remains engaging and effective. To maximise performance, A/B testing should be conducted regularly to refine messaging and improve conversion rates. Paid social media should be strategically integrated with email marketing and website CTAs, creating a cohesive multi-channel approach that drives sustained growth and engagement. Events publication and advertising Social media plays a vital role in promoting IESANZ events by increasing visibility, boosting engagement, and driving attendance. To maximise impact, a structured and strategic content plan should be implemented across platforms, ensuring consistent promotion leading up to each event. Social media advertising should highlight key event features, such as expert speakers, networking opportunities, industry insights, and CPD benefits. Engaging formats like video teasers, countdown posts, speaker highlights, and interactive Q&A sessions should be utilised to 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 79 
  capture audience interest. Paid social media campaigns should be highly targeted, reaching lighting professionals, architects, designers, engineers, and students to ensure strong attendance. To enhance engagement, behind-the-scenes content, live event coverage, and attendee testimonials should be shared before, during, and after the event. Post-event highlights, including recaps, key takeaways, and exclusive content for members, should be leveraged to maintain engagement beyond the event itself. A cohesive hashtag strategy should also be implemented to improve discoverability and encourage user-generated content from attendees. By combining organic content with paid promotion, IESANZ can expand its audience reach, increase event participation, and strengthen its industry presence through social media. Negative feedback management Social media is a key channel for member interactions, inquiries, and feedback, making effective community management essential for maintaining trust and a positive brand image. Negative feedback—whether regarding membership, events, or general experiences—should be addressed promptly, professionally, and transparently to demonstrate IESANZ’s commitment to its members. All comments, messages, and reviews should be monitored daily, with responses provided within 24-48 hours to prevent escalation and maintain positive engagement. For public concerns, a balanced approach should be taken acknowledging the issue, offering a solution, and, if necessary, moving the discussion to a private channel for further resolution. Canned responses should be avoided to ensure replies feel genuine and personalised. In addition to reactive engagement, IESANZ should take a proactive approach by regularly sharing positive member experiences, testimonials, and success stories to build credibility. Encouraging satisfied members to leave positive reviews and share their experiences can help counteract negative perceptions and strengthen community trust. A structured social media community management plan, including response guidelines, escalation processes, and sentiment analysis, should be developed to ensure all interactions align with IESANZ’s professional and solution-driven brand identity. By actively engaging with feedback, both positive and negative, IESANZ can foster a more engaged, responsive, and trusted online presence.

  Images and video Audit The use of imagery and video content on IESANZ platforms remains limited, inconsistent, and underutilised. Visuals are primarily featured on the awards page, event pages, and sporadically across social media, but they lack diversity and strategic intent. Event images tend to focus on award submissions and formal ceremony moments rather than showcasing broader industry engagement, networking, or thought leadership opportunities. Additionally, the absence of video content across platforms limits IESANZ’s ability to deliver dynamic and engaging storytelling that resonates with members and potential audiences. The organisation relies heavily on outdated and generic stock images, which do not effectively represent its evolving brand identity or the vibrancy of the lighting industry. The current image library appears static and fragmented, with no structured approach to capturing, curating, and leveraging high-quality imagery and video content to enhance visibility, engagement, and brand positioning.  Strategy IESANZ should establish a strategic, structured, and forward-thinking approach to imagery and video content across all platforms. A comprehensive and regularly updated visual library should be created, capturing high-quality photos and videos at endorsed events, industry functions, and chapter activities. Award submission visuals should be repurposed for social media, newsletters, and marketing campaigns to reinforce IESANZ’s leadership in recognising industry excellence. Video content should become a priority, incorporating event highlights, educational snippets, behind-the-scenes footage, and member testimonials to create more engaging and interactive communication. Chapters should be encouraged to contribute images and videos regularly, ensuring regional diversity in content while reflecting the association’s broad membership base. Stock imagery should only be used as a supplementary resource and must be carefully selected to align with brand guidelines and industry relevance. Implementing consistent branding and integration of imagery across all platforms will strengthen IESANZ’s marketing efforts, enhance professionalism, and position the association as a modern and visually compelling organisation.  Image and video actions • Develop a structured and regularly updated image and video library, capturing high-quality visuals from chapter events, endorsed industry gatherings, awards ceremonies, and networking sessions. • Implement a process for consistent video content creation, including event highlights, industry insights, interviews, and educational segments for social media and the website. 
IESANZ   | Marketing Action Plan |  page 82 
  • Ensure all IESANZ-endorsed events include professional photography and videography, with visuals repurposed for marketing, social media, and promotional materials. • Encourage chapters to submit region-specific images and video content regularly, ensuring diverse representation of IESANZ's broad membership base. • Standardise the integration of high-quality imagery and video across all platforms, ensuring brand consistency and a polished professional look. • Utilise video storytelling techniques to highlight key initiatives such as professional development programs, networking opportunities, awards recognition, and advocacy efforts. • Phase out outdated stock imagery in favour of authentic, engaging, and relevant visuals that better reflect the IESANZ brand and mission. • Expand video content on social media platforms, particularly on LinkedIn, YouTube, and TikTok, to increase reach, engagement, and visibility among younger professionals and industry stakeholders. • Develop a framework for capturing and leveraging member-generated content, including testimonials, case studies, and day-in-the-life features to enhance authenticity.
