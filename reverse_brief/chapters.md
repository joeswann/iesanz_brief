# Chapters Reverse Brief

- **Mission & Structure**
  - Provide localized experiences for each regional chapter (events, awards, news, committee, calendar, gallery, store) per Reverse Brief.
  - Balance autonomy for volunteers with national oversight on branding, compliance, and integrations.
  - Enable chapters to surface their contributions within board portfolios (conferences, education, marketing, memberships).

- **Content & Permissions**
  - Chapter admins can manage localized content blocks (news posts, event listings, award spotlights, galleries, committee bios, contact info).
  - Apply granular RBAC so chapters can edit their scope while HQ controls cross-chapter/global elements and approvals.
  - Provide templates (from marketing plan) to ensure consistent typography, imagery, and tone across chapter pages.

- **Events & Calendars**
  - Allow chapters to create upcoming/past events with member vs non-member pricing, sponsorship tiers, and ticket availability.
  - Sync chapter calendars with national feeds, enabling filtering by chapter, event type, and hybrid/virtual tags; power a consolidated “all events” diary Andrew requested so visitors can browse everything from one view.
  - Offer attendee management, payment status visibility, and reporting for chapter coordinators.

- **Awards & Galleries**
  - Support chapter-level awards, linking to central judging workflows while allowing localized promotion of winners/finalists.
  - Provide gallery tools for chapter events and award highlights with tag filters and responsive layouts.

- **Commerce & Storefronts**
  - Configure chapter-specific store items (sponsorships, advertising, merchandise) within national Shopify/Eventbrite frameworks.
  - Enforce tax/currency rules and route revenue to correct accounts while sharing reports with finance.

- **Communication & Engagement**
  - Enable chapter bulletins, newsletters, and social embeds with preference-aware targeting.
  - Provide contact forms and directory of committee members to facilitate local outreach and mentoring.

- **Governance & Support**
  - Document SOPs for chapter operations, including onboarding of new volunteers, content approval workflows, and escalation paths.
  - Track metrics per chapter (membership growth, event attendance, content cadence) in analytics dashboards.
  - Ensure training materials, help articles, and toolkit downloads are accessible for chapters during BOT handover.
