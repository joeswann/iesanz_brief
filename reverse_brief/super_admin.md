# Super Admin Reverse Brief

- **Mandate & Governance**
  - Own global configuration for branding, navigation, integrations, automation rules, and compliance as outlined in context.md Proposal + Reverse Brief.
  - Approve multi-environment deployments (dev/staging/prod), schema evolutions, and outsourcing decisions tied to BOT/maintenance models.
  - Coordinate with board portfolio leads (Conferences, Awards, Education, Marketing, Memberships) to balance national objectives with chapter autonomy.

- **Identity, Access & Security**
  - Define RBAC tiers (public, member, chapter admin, admin, board) and enforce MFA/SSO, device policies, and limited public attack surface (headless CMS, static frontend, WAF).
  - Maintain centralized directory for service accounts spanning CMS, CRM, Shopify, Stripe, Xero, Eventbrite, Mailchimp/Campaign Monitor, analytics, Buffer, OneDrive.
  - Oversee incident response: backups, malware/firewall stack, penetration testing cadence, and disaster-recovery runbooks.

- **Data, Integrations & Compliance**
  - Govern datalake/content lake strategy, retention policies, privacy controls (opt-ins, suppression lists), and multi-region requirements (AU/NZ GST, currency).
  - Validate payment/accounting workflows (Stripe ↔ Xero) plus future services (CPD tracking, corporate accounts) before enabling to lower risk of plugin sprawl.
  - Track legal/ESG commitments (per Purple Giraffe ESG section) to ensure accessibility, sustainability messaging, and inclusive data handling.

- **Observability & Reporting**
  - Maintain executive dashboards spanning membership KPIs, revenue, awards pipeline, education uptake, marketing performance, and site reliability.
  - Access automation logs, API status pages, integration health checks, and audit exports for governance/board reporting.
  - Align measurement with Success Metrics (systems, usability, memberships) and intervene when metrics miss thresholds.

- **Vendor & BOT Oversight**
  - Document responsibilities among agency, chapters, and volunteers for content updates vs backend maintenance; confirm training completion before handover.
  - Evaluate plugin/third-party proposals (e.g., WordPress stack vs headless) for security/performance impacts, capturing decisions for future audits.
  - Approve maintenance windows, hotfix procedures, and escalation paths, ensuring continuity even when volunteers change.
