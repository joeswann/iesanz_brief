## Attendee & Venue Operations
- Maintain admin dashboards for attendee management, check-in, seating assignments (awards dinner), special requirements, and travel info.
- Coordinate venue logistics, catering, AV, and accessibility considerations with documented runbooks and escalation paths.
- Manage sponsorship packages (exhibitor booths, speaking slots, branded sessions) with deliverable tracking aligned to [Store & Sponsorships](../2_frontend/2_5_store.md).

## Hybrid Delivery & Technology
- Support livestream scheduling, virtual networking, interactive Q&A/polls, simultaneous chat moderation, and capture media for on-demand portals.
- Monitor platform health, redundancy, and failover plans; log incidents for review by [Super Admin Governance](../4_super_admin/4_1_super_admin.md).

## Chapter & Vendor Coordination
- Provide templates and toolkits so chapters can run local conferences/meetups while sharing infrastructure (registration, email sequences, signage kits).
- Track vendor contracts (venues, AV providers, livestream platforms) and approvals, linking to [Automation](../5_integrations/5_1_automation.md) for communications and [Integrations](../5_integrations/5_2_integrations.md) for data syncs.

## Risk & Contingency Planning
- Maintain contingency plans for hybrid/virtual pivots (pandemics, travel disruptions) and compliance with venue safety regulations.
- Keep risk registers for regional/time-zone complexity, ensuring ownership and mitigation steps are reviewed quarterly.
- Ensure accurate data syncing with memberships/accounts for discount eligibility and revenue reporting, in partnership with [Finance & Payments](6_3_payments.md).

## Data & Reporting
- Push attendance, revenue, sponsor delivery, and satisfaction metrics to [Analytics](6_1_analytics.md) and board dashboards.
- Capture qualitative feedback loops (surveys, incident retros) and surface them inside the admin console for future planning.
