## Juror & Judging Management
- Manage juror empanelment workflows for nominations, selection, onboarding, confidentiality, and conflict management.
- Provide adjudication tooling with stage-based scoring, comments, rankings, and exports to spreadsheets for collation.
- Enforce role-based access so judges only view assigned entries; maintain audit logs for compliance, especially before winners are public.

## Admin Consoles & Workflows
- Review/approve submissions, track payment state, and trigger transactional emails from the admin console linked to [Admin Console & Operations](3_3_admin_console.md).
- Coordinate file routing to OneDrive and large-asset optimisation so volunteers never handle storage infrastructure directly.
- Surface sponsorship deliverables (tables, signage, interviews) and integrate with [Store & Sponsorships](../2_frontend/2_5_store.md) for catalogue consistency.

## Automation, Integrations & Compliance
- Run automated reminders for entry deadlines, incomplete submissions, juror tasks, sponsorship deliverables, and award-night logistics using the patterns in [Automation](../5_integrations/5_1_automation.md).
- Integrate CMS ↔ CRM for eligibility, Stripe/Xero for payments, Eventbrite/Shopify for ticketing, analytics for performance, and marketing automation for announcements per [Integrations](../5_integrations/5_2_integrations.md).
- Apply GST, invoice, and reconciliation controls from [Finance & Payments](6_3_payments.md) and reuse [Forms Framework](6_4_forms.md) standards for intake UX.

## Data & Reporting
- Feed entry counts, payment status, judging progress, and sponsorship fulfilment into [Analytics](6_1_analytics.md) for Success Metrics reporting.
- Maintain export templates for board packs and marketing storytelling (winners, testimonials) to keep context alignment.

## Risks & Next Steps
- Embargo breaches, juror conflicts, and file mismanagement require strict RBAC and audit trails—coordinate with [Security & Compliance](6_6_security.md).
- Plan SIT/UAT cycles ahead of each awards season per plan/phases.md to avoid regressions.
