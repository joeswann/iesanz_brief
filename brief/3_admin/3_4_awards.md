# Awards Operations

## Summary
- Houses the backstage processes that power the public experience described in [[02_frontend/02_02_awards|Awards Program]].
- Covers juror onboarding, adjudication tooling, automation, compliance, and sponsorship fulfilment so chapters and HQ have a single operational reference.

## Juror & Judging Management
- Manage juror empanelment workflows for nominations, selection, onboarding, confidentiality, and conflict management.
- Provide adjudication tooling with stage-based scoring, comments, rankings, and exports to spreadsheets for collation.
- Enforce role-based access so judges only view assigned entries; maintain audit logs for compliance, especially before winners are public.

## Admin Consoles & Workflows
- Review/approve submissions, track payment state, and trigger transactional emails from the admin console linked to [[03_admin/03_03_admin_console|Admin Console & Operations]].
- Coordinate file routing to OneDrive and large-asset optimisation so volunteers never handle storage infrastructure directly.
- Surface sponsorship deliverables (tables, signage, interviews) and integrate with [[02_frontend/02_05_store|Store & Sponsorships]] for catalogue consistency.

## Automation, Integrations & Compliance
- Run automated reminders for entry deadlines, incomplete submissions, juror tasks, sponsorship deliverables, and award-night logistics using the patterns in [[05_integrations/05_01_automation|Automation]].
- Integrate CMS ↔ CRM for eligibility, Stripe/Xero for payments, Eventbrite/Shopify for ticketing, analytics for performance, and marketing automation for announcements per [[05_integrations/05_02_integrations|Integrations]].
- Apply GST, invoice, and reconciliation controls from [[07_appendix/07_03_finance_payments|Finance & Payments]] and reuse [[07_appendix/07_04_forms|Forms Framework]] standards for intake UX.
