# Admin Console & Operations

## Summary
- Defines the day-to-day operational cockpit across memberships, awards, events, store, communications, reporting, and chapter oversight (Spec v3 “Management CRM”).
- Provides BOT-ready processes so HQ can delegate execution to chapters while maintaining compliance, financial integrity, and brand standards.
- Surfaces live KPIs (failed payments, lapsed members, import errors) with drill-down history aligned to Success Metrics and links back to [CMS Architecture](3_1_cms.md).

## Roles & Permissions
- Personas include secretariat/admin, finance/accounts, chapter coordinators, volunteer coordinators, and board observers with configurable permission sets and audit logs.
- Allow chapter-managed landing pages while retaining central overrides and approvals coordinated with [Chapters](3_2_chapters.md).

## Legacy Transition
- Migrate Monday.com/Approval Max workflows into the new system with data validation, dual-run strategies, and documented cutovers.
- Track outstanding tasks and change logs so future vendors understand historic decisions.

## Commerce & Finance Ops
- Manage product catalogues (memberships, upgrades, tickets, sponsorships, publications) with purchasing-on-behalf, GST routing, and reconciliation tooling tied to Xero per [Finance & Payments](../7_appendix/7_3_payments.md).
- Surface alerts for failed payments, orphaned invoices, and sponsorship fulfilment deadlines.

## Program Administration
- Configure award/event forms, juror processes, attendee tracking, sponsorship commitments, refunds, and galleries in partnership with [Awards Operations](3_4_awards.md) and [Events & Conferences Operations](3_5_events.md).
- Keep escalation paths clear so chapter volunteers know when to hand off to national office or vendor support.

## Communications & Engagement
- Operate bulletin boards, calendars, and transactional messaging in partnership with [Communications](../7_appendix/7_2_communications.md).
- Ensure template usage, approval flows, and incident comms are logged for audit.

## Reporting & Support
- Deliver historical snapshots, chapter dashboards, SOPs, training, template libraries, and incident logs for Super Admin review.
- Use analytics hooks from [Analytics](../7_appendix/7_1_analytics.md) to trigger interventions (e.g., lapsed members, event drop-off).
