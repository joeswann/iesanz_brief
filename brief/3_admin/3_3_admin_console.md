# Admin Console & Operations

## Summary
- Defines the day-to-day operational cockpit across memberships, awards, events, store, communications, reporting, and chapter oversight (Spec v3 “Management CRM”).
- Provides BOT-ready processes so HQ can delegate execution to chapters while maintaining compliance, financial integrity, and brand standards.
- Surfaces live KPIs (failed payments, lapsed members, import errors) with drill-down history aligned to Success Metrics and links back to [[03_admin/03_01_cms|CMS Architecture]].

## Roles & Permissions
- Personas include secretariat/admin, finance/accounts, chapter coordinators, volunteer coordinators, and board observers with configurable permission sets and audit logs.
- Allow chapter-managed landing pages while retaining central overrides and approvals coordinated with [[03_admin/03_02_chapters|Chapters]].

## Legacy Transition
- Migrate Monday.com/Approval Max workflows into the new system with data validation, dual-run strategies, and documented cutovers.
- Track outstanding tasks and change logs so future vendors understand historic decisions.

## Commerce & Finance Ops
- Manage product catalogues (memberships, upgrades, tickets, sponsorships, publications) with purchasing-on-behalf, GST routing, and reconciliation tooling tied to Xero per [[07_appendix/07_03_finance_payments|Finance & Payments]].
- Surface alerts for failed payments, orphaned invoices, and sponsorship fulfilment deadlines.

## Program Administration
- Configure award/event forms, juror processes, attendee tracking, sponsorship commitments, refunds, and galleries in partnership with [[03_admin/03_04_awards_ops|Awards Operations]] and [[03_admin/03_05_events_ops|Events & Conferences Operations]].
- Keep escalation paths clear so chapter volunteers know when to hand off to national office or vendor support.

## Communications & Engagement
- Operate bulletin boards, calendars, and transactional messaging in partnership with [[07_appendix/07_02_communications|Communications]].
- Ensure template usage, approval flows, and incident comms are logged for audit.

## Reporting & Support
- Deliver historical snapshots, chapter dashboards, SOPs, training, template libraries, and incident logs for Super Admin review.
- Use analytics hooks from [[07_appendix/07_01_analytics|Analytics]] to trigger interventions (e.g., lapsed members, event drop-off).
