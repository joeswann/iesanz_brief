# Events & Conferences Operations

## Summary
- Provides the operational companion to [[02_frontend/02_03_conferences|Conferences]], detailing how HQ and chapters run registrations, hybrid delivery, and sponsor fulfilment.
- Consolidates the SOPs previously scattered across the legacy microsite so BOT-ready teams can execute consistently.

## Attendee & Venue Operations
- Maintain admin dashboards for attendee management, check-in, seating assignments (awards dinner), special requirements, and travel info.
- Coordinate venue logistics, catering, AV, and accessibility considerations with documented runbooks and escalation paths.
- Manage sponsorship packages (exhibitor booths, speaking slots, branded sessions) with deliverable tracking aligned to [[02_frontend/02_05_store|Store & Sponsorships]].

## Hybrid Delivery & Technology
- Support livestream scheduling, virtual networking, interactive Q&A/polls, simultaneous chat moderation, and capture media for on-demand portals.
- Monitor platform health, redundancy, and failover plans; log incidents for review by [[04_super_admin/04_01_super_admin|Super Admin Governance]].

## Chapter & Vendor Coordination
- Provide templates and toolkits so chapters can run local conferences/meetups while sharing infrastructure (registration, email sequences, signage kits).
- Track vendor contracts (venues, AV providers, livestream platforms) and approvals, linking to [[05_integrations/05_01_automation|Automation]] for communications and [[05_integrations/05_02_integrations|Integrations]] for data syncs.

## Risk & Contingency Planning
- Maintain contingency plans for hybrid/virtual pivots (pandemics, travel disruptions) and compliance with venue safety regulations.
- Keep risk registers for regional/time-zone complexity, ensuring ownership and mitigation steps are reviewed quarterly.
- Ensure accurate data syncing with memberships/accounts for discount eligibility and revenue reporting, in partnership with [[07_appendix/07_03_finance_payments|Finance & Payments]].
