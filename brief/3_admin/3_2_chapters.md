## Mission & Structure
  - Provide localized experiences for each regional chapter (events, awards, news, committee, calendar, gallery, store) per Reverse Brief.
  - Balance autonomy for volunteers with national oversight on branding, compliance, and integrations.
  - Enable chapters to surface their contributions within board portfolios (conferences, education, marketing, memberships).

| Persona | Responsibilities | Key Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chapter Coordinator | Publish events/news, manage contacts | CMS chapter space, Admin Console |
| Volunteer Treasurer | Track payments, invoices, remittances | Store dashboards, Xero views (read-only) |
| Marketing Lead | Run newsletters/social, update galleries | CMS templates, Communications hub |
| Committee Chair | Approve content, escalate risks | Admin Console approvals, Governance docs |

## Content & Permissions
  - Chapter admins can manage localized content blocks (news posts, event listings, award spotlights, galleries, committee bios, contact info).
  - Apply granular RBAC so chapters can edit their scope while HQ controls cross-chapter/global elements and approvals.
  - Provide templates (from marketing plan) to ensure consistent typography, imagery, and tone across chapter pages.

## Events & Calendars
  - Allow chapters to create upcoming/past events with member vs non-member pricing, sponsorship tiers, and ticket availability.
  - Sync chapter calendars with national feeds, enabling filtering by chapter, event type, and hybrid/virtual tags; power a consolidated “all events” diary Andrew requested so visitors can browse everything from one view.
  - Offer attendee management, payment status visibility, and reporting for chapter coordinators.

## Awards & Galleries
  - Support chapter-level awards, linking to central judging workflows while allowing localized promotion of winners/finalists.
  - Provide gallery tools for chapter events and award highlights with tag filters and responsive layouts.

## Commerce & Storefronts
  - Configure chapter-specific store items (sponsorships, advertising, merchandise) within national Shopify/Eventbrite frameworks.
  - Enforce tax/currency rules and route revenue to correct accounts while sharing reports with finance.

## Communication & Engagement
  - Enable chapter bulletins, newsletters, and social embeds with preference-aware targeting.
  - Provide contact forms and directory of committee members to facilitate local outreach and mentoring.

## Governance & Support
  - Document SOPs for chapter operations, including onboarding of new volunteers, content approval workflows, and escalation paths.
  - Track metrics per chapter (membership growth, event attendance, content cadence) in analytics dashboards.
  - Ensure training materials, help articles, and toolkit downloads are accessible for chapters during BOT handover.

## Risks & Next Steps
- Volunteer turnover demands ongoing training—link to `2_4_knowledgebase.md` BOT resources.
- Misaligned pricing or branding should trigger escalation to [Super Admin Governance](../4_super_admin/4_1_super_admin.md) and [Marketing Strategy](../6_appendix/6_5_marketing.md).
