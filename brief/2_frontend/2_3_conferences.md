## Objectives
- Support the biennial IESANZ conference plus chapter-led symposia, hybrid/virtual events, and regional meetups referenced across context.md and Purple Giraffe plan.
- Tie conference outcomes to board portfolios (Conferences, Education, Marketing, Memberships) and sponsorship revenue goals.
- Provide a cohesive user experience from promotion through registration, attendance, and post-event engagement.
- Consolidate the legacy standalone conference microsite into the main platform, handling content migration, redirects, and branding alignment.

## Program & Content
  - Feature tracks aligned to smart lighting, human-centric design, sustainability/ESG, advocacy/policy, and member success stories.
  - Include awards showcases, education workshops, CPD sessions, networking mixers, mentorship programs, and branded merchandise opportunities.
  - Capture on-demand content (recordings, slide decks) for the download portal/knowledgebase and future marketing assets.

## Registration & Commerce
  - Offer tiered ticketing (member, non-member, student, corporate, sponsor), multi-currency pricing, GST logic (AU/NZ), and bundles (conference + awards + education add-ons).
  - Integrate with Stripe/Xero for invoicing, Eventbrite/Shopify for payment/fulfilment, and allow purchase on behalf of others or corporate delegates under policies set in [Finance & Payments](6_3_payments.md).
  - Manage sponsorship packages (exhibitor booths, speaking slots, branded sessions) with deliverable tracking.

## Marketing & Engagement
  - Align promotional calendar with marketing action plan: early bird campaigns, speaker announcements, social media content, PR coverage.
  - Create microsites/landing pages with agendas, speaker bios, sponsor logos, testimonials, and call-to-action modules.
  - Feed leads to CRM for nurturing (membership upsell, education cross-sell) and provide post-event surveys/feedback loops.

## Operational Links
- Attendee management, hybrid delivery logistics, contingency planning, and volunteer coordination are governed in [Events & Conferences Operations](../3_admin/3_5_events.md).
- That chapter also holds risk registers, vendor playbooks, and SOPs so the public-facing experience stays focused on storytelling and conversion.

## Dependencies & Hand-offs
- Payments, invoicing, and sponsorship bundles feed into [Finance & Payments](6_3_payments.md) and [Store & Sponsorships](2_5_store.md).
- Automation (reminders, surveys, post-event nurture) depends on [Automation](../5_integrations/5_1_automation.md) and [Communications](6_2_communications.md).
- Data capture and analytics route to [Analytics](6_1_analytics.md) and [Education & CPD](2_7_education.md) for long-term engagement tracking.

## Risks & Considerations
- Hybrid delivery adds technical failure risk—mirror the contingency plans in [Events & Conferences Operations](../3_admin/3_5_events.md).
- Legacy microsite migration must include redirects and SEO hygiene from [SEO](6_7_seo.md).
- Sponsor/delegate data accuracy is critical for cross-selling; align with CRM governance in [Super Admin Governance](../4_super_admin/4_1_super_admin.md).
