## Purpose & Scope
  - Support the biennial IESANZ conference plus chapter-led symposia, hybrid/virtual events, and regional meetups referenced across context.md and Purple Giraffe plan.
  - Tie conference outcomes to board portfolios (Conferences, Education, Marketing, Memberships) and sponsorship revenue goals.
  - Provide a cohesive user experience from promotion through registration, attendance, and post-event engagement.
  - Consolidate the legacy standalone conference microsite into the main platform, handling content migration, redirects, and branding alignment.

## Program & Content
  - Feature tracks aligned to smart lighting, human-centric design, sustainability/ESG, advocacy/policy, and member success stories.
  - Include awards showcases, education workshops, CPD sessions, networking mixers, mentorship programs, and branded merchandise opportunities.
  - Capture on-demand content (recordings, slide decks) for the download portal/knowledgebase and future marketing assets.

## Registration & Commerce
  - Offer tiered ticketing (member, non-member, student, corporate, sponsor), multi-currency pricing, GST logic (AU/NZ), and bundles (conference + awards + education add-ons).
  - Integrate with Stripe/Xero for invoicing, Eventbrite/Shopify for payment/fulfilment, and allow purchase on behalf of others or corporate delegates under policies set in [Finance & Payments](../7_appendix/7_3_payments.md).
  - Manage sponsorship packages (exhibitor booths, speaking slots, branded sessions) with deliverable tracking.

## Marketing & Engagement
  - Align promotional calendar with marketing action plan: early bird campaigns, speaker announcements, social media content, PR coverage.
  - Create microsites/landing pages with agendas, speaker bios, sponsor logos, testimonials, and call-to-action modules.
  - Feed leads to CRM for nurturing (membership upsell, education cross-sell) and provide post-event surveys/feedback loops.

## Operations & Governance
  - Attendee management, hybrid delivery logistics, contingency planning, and volunteer coordination are governed in [Events & Conferences Operations](../3_admin/3_5_events.md).
  - That chapter also holds risk registers, vendor playbooks, and SOPs so the public-facing experience stays focused on storytelling and conversion.
