## Personas & Access Layers
  - Individuals: students, emerging professionals, accredited members, senior fellows seeking CPD, networking, awards participation.
  - Corporate delegates: organizations purchasing memberships/tickets, managing team rosters, accessing sponsorship benefits (future corporate accounts).
  - Chapters & board: need elevated visibility yet consume member-facing dashboards for situational awareness.
  - Non-members/prospects: browse value (events, education, publications) and convert via clear CTAs.
- 
## Membership Self-Service
- Public storytelling and conversion flows that let prospects join, compare benefits, register interest, then hand off seamlessly to authenticated Member Hub actions.
- Logged-in dashboard actions for renewing, upgrading/downgrading, cancelling, managing preferences, buying add-ons, and accessing invoices/certificates.
- History views (payments, CPD when live, awards participation) surfaced contextually so members can self-serve without raising tickets.
- Inline controls for communication and privacy preferences, plus chapter affiliation management to keep directories and alerts accurate.
- Future corporate account mode that allows for self-managed groups, managing seats, tickets, and sponsorship inclusions in one place.


## Member Hub Experience
  - Unified dashboard surface: membership status, invoices, payment methods, CPD tracker (future), awards entries, education enrollments, event tickets, sponsorship orders, communications feed.
  - Action shortcuts mirroring Reverse Brief membership hub list (sign up, renew, upgrade, education, events, form submissions, payments, CPD points).
  - Chapter widgets: local news, committee contacts, calendars, galleries, store offers, and targeted alerts filtered automatically based on location/affiliation.

## Self-Service & Support
  - Profile management: contact info, professional details, privacy preferences, communication consents, chapter affiliation, directory opt-in/out.
  - Account recovery flows (password reset, renewal reactivation), payment method updates, invoice downloads, certificate retrieval.
  - Help center coverage: membership assistance, education assistance, mentorship, policy/advocacy, FAQs, toolkits referenced in context Planning.
  - Store access for publications, job ads, sponsorships with member vs non-member pricing and ability to purchase on behalf of others.

## Community & Visibility
  - Member lookup/directory with filters (grade, specialty, chapter) respecting privacy consent; highlight recognition (awards, credentials).
  - Integrate PR/social storytelling to counter perception of outdated organisation and engage younger professionals (Purple Giraffe SWOT).
  - Offer mentorship matching, discussion groups, and future community space hooks per Next Steps > Future.

## Considerations
  - Data accuracy depends on syncing CRM, CMS, finance (Stripe/Xero), awards, education; implement validation and escalation workflows.
  - Accessibility and low-click journeys are essential for volunteer-heavy audience; continuous UX testing required.
  - Privacy/GDPR/Spam Act compliance for communications and public directory participation; provide granular opt-outs and audit trails.

## Data Contracts
- Inputs: membership CRM (status, grade, chapter), finance (payments, invoices), awards (entries, results), education (enrolments, CPD), events (tickets), communications preferences.
- Outputs: dashboard widgets, analytics telemetry, marketing segments, automation triggers.
- Owners: data stewards defined in [Super Admin Governance](../4_super_admin/4_1_super_admin.md) ensure schemas remain consistent across releases.
