## Summary
- Sets out the end-to-end awards lifecycle from entries to showcase, aligning with board portfolios and marketing/sponsorship goals.
- Highlights submission tooling, judging administration, payment flows, and gallery storytelling requirements.
- Emphasises automation, integrations, and compliance controls for BOT-ready operations.

## Lifecycle & Objectives
  - Deliver an end-to-end awards experience that surpasses reference sites (e.g., CIBSE) with superior visuals, responsiveness, and storytelling (client brief).
  - Align awards with board portfolios, marketing goals, sponsorship packages, and membership value propositions (context Reverse Brief + Purple Giraffe plan).
  - Support public promotion, member recognition, juror collaboration, and historical archiving for BOT-style handover.

## Entries & Payments
  - Multi-step/tabbed entry forms with save/resume, eligibility rules tied to member status, and structured data that flows into judging packs.
  - Secure upload pipelines hand entries into the admin workspace maintained in [[03_admin/03_04_awards_ops|Awards Operations]], keeping media optimized without burdening entrants.
  - Shopping-cart checkout enabling multiple entries, dinner tickets (tables/seats), sponsorship add-ons, and consolidated invoices; allow invoice requests and online payments.
  - Handle AUD/NZD currencies, AU/NZ GST + GST-free configurations, and purchasing on behalf of others through storefront components governed by [[07_appendix/07_03_finance_payments|Finance & Payments]].

## Showcase & Content Delivery
  - CMS-driven gallery pages with carousels, tag-filtered grids (category, chapter, year), media captions, and accessibility compliance.
  - Storytelling blocks for case studies, interviews, testimonials, and PR-ready summaries, feeding marketing channels and newsletters.
  - Archive management for past winners, juror bios, downloadable media kits, and sponsorship recognition placements.

## Operations & Governance
  - Administrative tooling for jurors, judges, and sponsorship tracking lives in [[03_admin/03_04_awards_ops|Awards Operations]] so this chapter can stay focused on the public experience.
  - Integrations, compliance, automation, and reporting guardrails are documented there as well, ensuring a single source of truth for backstage workflows.
