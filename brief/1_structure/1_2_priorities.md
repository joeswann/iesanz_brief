# Priorities Framework

> **Source Inputs**: context.md (Success Metrics, Next Steps, Governance themes), plan/priorities.md, plan/phases.md

## Summary
- Establishes how initiatives are scored on value, effort, difficulty, and urgency so sequencing decisions remain transparent to the board and future vendors.
- Highlights the macro themes (platform integrity, member value, brand reach, governance) that drive High/Mid/Low tiers and links directly to the plan workspace.

## Purpose
- Provide a consistent decision lens for quarterly and phase planning, ensuring delivery stays aligned with board expectations and BOT commitments.
- Maintain visibility for handover partners—chapters, contractors, new vendors—so they understand why backlogs are ordered the way they are.

## Evaluation Criteria
### Value
- Measures contribution to membership growth/retention, revenue, advocacy influence, and user experience improvements outlined in context.md.
### Effort
- Considers relative size spanning design, engineering, content, change management, and cross-vendor coordination.
### Difficulty
- Captures technical complexity, dependencies on legacy systems (e.g., Monday.com, Approval Max), and regulatory exposure (PCI, privacy).
### Urgency
- Reflects time pressures such as award cycles, conference deadlines, financial year renewals, or compliance mandates.

## Priority Bands
### High
- Foundational platform capabilities (CMS schemas, frontend navigation, admin console), revenue-critical flows (multi-currency payments, store, awards, conferences), governance/security (SSO/MFA, audit trails), and experience wins (member hub, knowledgebase access).
### Mid
- Scaling programs (education depth, CPD roadmap, chapter marketing kits, automation templates) that unlock incremental value once foundations are stable.
### Low/Future
- Horizon initiatives (community space, advanced personalization, APAC expansion) that should be architected for but can launch post-BOT commitments.

## Themes Influencing Priority
- **Platform & Data Integrity** – headless CMS schemas, analytics lake maturity, integration reliability, and Monday.com migration.
- **Membership & Revenue** – catalog rebuilds, upgrade workflows, ecommerce unification, event/awards monetisation.
- **Brand & Engagement** – rebrand assets, marketing automation, communications preference center, SEO baseline.
- **Governance & Security** – RBAC/SOAR practices, chapter autonomy with guardrails, compliance documentation, training cadence.

## Usage Guidance
- Apply the scoring model during quarterly/phase planning and record rationale within the plan workspace for traceability.
- Reassess after major milestones (CMS launch, conference cycle) to rebalance HQ vs chapter effort.
- Maintain a loop with board portfolios to confirm whether strategic or market shifts warrant reprioritisation.

## Worked Example
| Initiative | Value | Effort | Difficulty | Urgency | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CMS schema + membership gating | High (revenue + UX) | High | High (legacy data) | High (Phase 1) | Enables 2.x/6.x experiences |
| CPD tracker MVP | Mid | Mid | Mid | Low | Depends on education backlog stability |
| Community space pilot | Low | Mid | High | Low | Architect hooks only in current phases |
