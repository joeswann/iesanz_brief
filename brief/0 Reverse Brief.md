## IESANZ

IESANZ is an international organisation based in Australia and New Zealand. It’s organisational structure consists of a central board with portfolios for fundamental areas of the organisation (Awards, Conferences, Education, etc) and six chapters (NZ, NSW + ACT, WA, VIC + TAS, SA + NT, QLD), these all have an influence on the governance and administration of the overall organisation and the website. 

## Purpose

This project is a comprehensive renewal of the IESANZ digital online presence, based around the functionality of the website located at [https://www.iesanz.org/](https://www.iesanz.org/). Once completed the new website will implement an intuitive, clean and functional interface for visitors and members, while streamlining a wide range of back office procedures through well planned digital processes and integrations.

## Approach

As there are several components and portfolios within the organisation there are quite a few disparate areas to integrate across the platform. This document will be organised into a number of groups and verticals that separate these areas, along with details around the various key components of the website structure and production process.

The brief will be organised as much as possible to reflect the business structure and processes that drive it, this includes the chapter system, board portfolios, and external drivers such as marketing and advertising.

The complexity of the brief will involve some careful consideration of priorities in order to produce a clearly successful result within a reasonable timeframe and budget. To that end we will highlight details which make sense to action in a future phase of the platforms evolution. 


## Outline
Visitors to the IESANZ platform can be grouped into several categories / segments, and the content they view can be determined by a number of factors such as which chapter they belong to, whether they are logged in, and which level of access they have. On the surface level there is public content, which is accessible by any visitor and is generally used for information about the organisation, marketing for the benefits of membership, and onboarding. Chapters communicate with their members through their hubs, which provide a centralised location for announcements and important information. Finally there are the member hubs, which are where the majority of the digital membership benefits are located. These include educational resources, ticket functionality, access to whitepapers, and so on.

## What does success look like

  - Support ~1,000 members (engineers, architects, educators, manufacturers, etc.) with a platform that is “more productive and value-driven” for admin, members, and chapters.
  - Grow/retain membership by clarifying value propositions, simplifying onboarding, and enabling upgrades/renewals as highlighted in context Success Metrics & Marketing plan.

## Design Brief
Improvements in branding, typography, layout, responsiveness, and storytelling. Integrate the informative public experience with the member/admin CRM side, ensuring users transition smoothly between marketing and membership flows. Reflect marketing objectives: highlight value propositions, member success stories, testimonials and clear CTAs for joining, attending, sponsoring, or learning.

## Public
All audiences visiting the website will be able to easily access public information published on the platform. The regularly updated aspect of this information will be public news related to organisation activities such as upcoming events and activities, while more static content will consist of general information around the organisation and guidance for new members.
- Storytelling blocks for case studies, interviews, testimonials, and PR-ready summaries, feeding marketing channels and newsletters.
- Public storytelling and conversion flows that let prospects join, compare benefits, register interest, then hand off seamlessly to authenticated Member Hub actions.
  - Member lookup/directory with filters (grade, specialty, chapter) respecting privacy consent; highlight recognition (awards, credentials).
  - Core content families from context.md Planning > Architecture: general pages, help articles, events, awards, bulletins, case studies, testimonials, white papers, interviews, blog/news, static pages (Objectives, FAQ, Conditions of Entry).
  - Portfolio/Board collections (Conferences, Awards, Education, Marketing, Memberships) plus chapter-specific clusters (events, awards, news, committee, calendar, gallery, store).
  - Knowledgebase groupings (membership assistance, education assistance, mentorship programs) and store collections (advertisements, sponsorships, products, bundles).
- Provide a centralized knowledgebase covering membership assistance, education assistance, mentorship programs, policy/advocacy, CPD guidance, and FAQs as outlined in context Planning > Architecture.
## Chapters
Chapters will be able to use various channels to reach visitors and members focused on their region. Channels can be either public or private, and initially will consist of static content (such as contact details for the chapter), and dynamic content such as upcoming or past events. 
  - Include awards showcases, education workshops, CPD sessions, networking mixers, mentorship programs, and branded merchandise opportunities.
- Localisation - eg AU / NZ currency, GST messaging, and chapter content context.
  - Provide localized experiences for each regional chapter (events, awards, news, committee, calendar, gallery, store) per Reverse Brief.

## Member Area
Once logged in members will have access to a deeper level of access to the organisation and its resources. The vision for this level of access includes educational content, technical papers, recorded videos, and so on.
Along with a deeper level of access to content, members will also have a range of functionality at their disposal once logged in. Members will be able to find and access gated content such as education and events through their account, along with the ability to request access to webinars, purchase tickets, and so on.
  - Unified dashboard surface: membership status, invoices, payment methods, CPD tracker (future), awards entries, education enrollments, event tickets, sponsorship orders, communications feed.

## Accounts
Members will be able to access and edit account level membership settings such as their email address, password, and profile details. In future these profile details can be used by the member to opt into the Member Directory. 
- Inline controls for communication and privacy preferences, plus chapter affiliation management to keep directories and alerts accurate.
  - Profile management: contact info, professional details, privacy preferences, communication consents, chapter affiliation, directory opt-in/out.

  - Account recovery flows (password reset, renewal reactivation), payment method updates, invoice downloads, certificate retrieval.
## Membership
Members will be able to access a range of forms through the member area for submitting upgrade requests for their standing in the organisation. In a future version members will also be able to directly manage their subscription through this system including their payment details and viewing previous/overdue payments. 
  - Multi-step/tabbed entry forms with save/resume, eligibility rules tied to member status, and structured data that flows into judging packs.
- Logged-in dashboard actions for renewing, upgrading/downgrading, cancelling, managing preferences, buying add-ons, and accessing invoices/certificates.
- History views (payments, CPD when live, awards participation) surfaced contextually so members can self-serve without raising tickets.
  - Individuals: students, emerging professionals, accredited members, senior fellows seeking CPD, networking, awards participation.
- Define membership grades (corporate, non-corporate, student, emerging professional, chapter tiers) with benefits, pricing tables, annual cloning rules, and add-ons (e.g., RLP) tied to financial-year planning.
- Maintain special status rules (terminated, resigned, lifetime, honorary) plus pro-rata/missed-payment remediation so finance and membership admin stay consistent.
- Oversee onboarding, renewal, upgrade/downgrade, reactivation, add-on, and corporate/group management workflows, ensuring SLAs, audit trails, and chapter notifications remain compliant.
- Mandate save/resume upgrade forms capturing credentials, referees, CPD logs, and supplementary docs before routing to chapter audit → national review → board approval.
- Track lifecycle states (active, grace, lapsed) with automated reminders (T-60/30/7) and reinstatement logic, escalating exceptions to the appropriate admin queues.

  - Support BOT handover by standardising how data is captured, stored, and surfaced across CMS, CRM, finance, and analytics systems.

## Experience Standards
  - Save & Resume: every multi-step form (e.g., membership upgrade, awards entry) offers authenticated save/resume, autosaves progress, and emails a secure resume link.
  - Draft & History: members can view past submissions, current drafts, and status updates in their hub, with ability to clone a prior submission for new cycles.
  - Validation & Guidance: inline validation, contextual tooltips, and dynamic help text tailored per membership grade or program; highlight missing compliance docs before submission.
  - Accessibility: WCAG-compliant controls, keyboard navigation, and responsive layouts that mirror the broader site’s typography and spacing guidelines.

## Form Types & Data Flows
  - Membership Lifecycle: join, renew, reactivate, upgrade/downgrade, add-ons (RLP, CPD packages) with conditional logic for corporate vs individual applicants.
  - Awards & Programs: entry forms, juror empanelment, adjudication sheets with OneDrive asset capture and adjudication export hooks.
  - Events & Commerce: ticket bundles, sponsorship requests, expression-of-interest forms linked to Eventbrite/Shopify workflows.
  - Support & Compliance: profile updates, chapter meeting minutes, governance attestations, and feedback surveys feeding analytics/reporting.
  - Each submission writes to canonical records, triggers automations (emails, approvals, tasks), and syncs status to finance (invoices), marketing (segments), and analytics dashboards.

### Shared Field Dictionary (Excerpt)

  - Implement file handling via secure uploads to OneDrive/Azure storage with virus scanning and permissioned access for reviewers.
  - Support multi-stage approval chains by combining form states with workflow engines (e.g., upgrade → chapter review → national committee → board), including audit logs and timestamps.

## Governance & Maintenance
  - Version every form (schema + logic) and store documentation on purpose, owners, triggers, and downstream dependencies.
  - Provide staging environments for testing new questions, calculations, or integrations before production release; bundle regression checklists with each update.
  - Monitor submission success rates, drop-off points, and error logs; surface insights to UX and automation teams for continuous improvement.

## Considerations
  - Large/complex forms risk abandonment—use progressive disclosure, autosave, and summary steps to reassure users.
