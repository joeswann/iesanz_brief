## Objectives & Scope
  - Outperform peer institutions (e.g., CIBSE) in organic visibility by combining technical excellence with rich storytelling across memberships, awards, education, advocacy, and resources.
  - Support evergreen queries (knowledgebase, policy, download portal, member lookup) and time-sensitive campaigns (awards deadlines, conferences, sponsorship pushes, education launches).
  - Tie SEO growth to marketing goals (awareness, engagement, membership conversion) outlined in the Purple Giraffe Marketing Action Plan.

## Technical Foundations
  - Headless frontend enables semantic markup, structured data (Organization, Event, Course, Article, FAQ, Review), clean URLs, and fast delivery.
  - Core Web Vitals emphasis: optimized galleries, lazy loading, CDN caching, minimal blocking scripts, observability dashboards feeding analytics KPIs.
  - Multiregional tactics: hreflang for AU/NZ, localized copy/currency/tax messaging, chapter landing pages, and support for potential APAC expansion opportunities noted in marketing plan.
  - Hardened security (private CMS, WAF, malware protection) prevents plugin-related regressions discussed in context.md.

## Content & Keyword Strategy
  - Cover CMS content families (general pages, help articles, events, awards, bulletins, case studies, testimonials, white papers, interviews, blog/news) plus knowledgebase topics (membership/education assistance, mentorship).
  - Highlight marketing storytelling pillars: member success, ESG initiatives, smart/human-centric lighting education, advocacy wins, innovation research.
  - Create structured directories for chapters, member lookup (opt-in), corporate memberships, sponsorship packages, CPD/education catalogs, and download teasers to capture long-tail demand.
  - Sync cadence with marketing calendar (newsletters, webinars, meetups) and board portfolio milestones to keep site fresh.

## Governance, Tooling & Measurement
- Allocate SEO tooling budget (Search Console, rank tracking, site audits) and schedule periodic technical/content reviews post-release or integration changes.
- Enforce editorial workflows for metadata, internal linking, canonical/redirect hygiene, schema tagging, and chapter template compliance.
- Feed SEO KPIs (traffic, rankings, conversions, Core Web Vitals, engagement) into analytics dashboards tied to Success Metrics; share insights with marketing/admin teams for action.

## Escalation & Review Cadence
- **Monthly**: Crawl health checks, Core Web Vitals review with frontend.
- **Quarterly**: Content gap analysis with marketing, redirect/canonical audit after major launches.
- **Annually**: Benchmark vs peers (e.g., CIBSE) and refresh schema strategies based on product/experience changes.
