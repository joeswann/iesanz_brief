## Purpose
  - Coordinate internal/member communications (bulletins, alerts, newsletters, transactional notices) distinct from external marketing campaigns.
  - Improve usability of communications per Spec v3 by offering structured feeds, preference management, and automation.
  - Support public, chapter, member, admin, and board audiences with targeted messaging.

## Channels & Content Types
  - Bulletin board with rich formatting, attachments, and scheduling; chapter-specific feeds filtered by membership tier or location.
  - System notifications: transactional emails/SMS (welcome, payment confirmations, renewals, award updates, event reminders).
  - Internal announcements for volunteers/admins, governance updates, policy notices, and incident communications.

## Preference & Access Management
  - Preference center enabling members to choose communication types (newsletters, chapter updates, advocacy alerts, marketing, SMS) while respecting mandatory notices.
  - Compliance with Spam Act/GDPR, consent tracking, suppression lists, and audit logging for changes.
  - Role-based visibility so chapters see their subscribers, while HQ can broadcast system-wide updates.

## Tooling & Automation
  - Integrate CMS/CRM with marketing automation platforms (Mailchimp/Campaign Monitor) and transactional email services.
  - Provide templates aligned with brand guidelines (per marketing plan) and allow localized content blocks for chapters.
  - Automate scheduling for recurring bulletins, event reminders, award timelines, and membership lifecycle triggers.

## UX & Delivery
  - Embed communication feeds within member hub dashboards, showing relevant updates with filters (public, chapter, private).
  - Offer digest options, archive search, and accessible formatting (WCAG) with mobile-friendly rendering.
  - Provide analytics on opens, clicks, and engagement to feed marketing/analytics dashboards.

## Considerations
  - Over-communication risk; implement frequency caps and segmentation to keep messages relevant.
  - Need contingency messaging for outages/incidents, coordinated with super-admin/IT.
  - Volunteers require training to avoid off-brand or non-compliant messaging; enforce approval workflows.
