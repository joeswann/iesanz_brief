  - Highlight conference cycles (biennial event), chapter-level calendars, knowledgebase articles, and career development opportunities.
  - Provide register/search for expert members (e.g., MIES approvers) and showcase testimonials/interviews to improve storytelling (marketing audit finding).

## Enrolment & Commerce
