# Members Hub

## Summary
- Defines personas spanning individuals, corporates, chapters, board observers, and prospects, ensuring each can see relevant value.
- Outlines the unified member hub experience, self-service tooling, and community features required to modernise perception.
- Notes dependencies on accurate data syncing, accessibility, and privacy compliance.

## Personas & Access Layers
  - Individuals: students, emerging professionals, accredited members, senior fellows seeking CPD, networking, awards participation.
  - Corporate delegates: organizations purchasing memberships/tickets, managing team rosters, accessing sponsorship benefits (future corporate accounts).
  - Chapters & board: need elevated visibility yet consume member-facing dashboards for situational awareness.
  - Non-members/prospects: browse value (events, education, publications) and convert via clear CTAs.

## Member Hub Experience
  - Unified dashboard surface: membership status, invoices, payment methods, CPD tracker (future), awards entries, education enrollments, event tickets, sponsorship orders, communications feed.
  - Action shortcuts mirroring Reverse Brief membership hub list (sign up, renew, upgrade, education, events, form submissions, payments, CPD points).
  - Chapter widgets: local news, committee contacts, calendars, galleries, store offers, and targeted alerts filtered automatically based on location/affiliation.

## Self-Service & Support
  - Profile management: contact info, professional details, privacy preferences, communication consents, chapter affiliation, directory opt-in/out.
  - Account recovery flows (password reset, renewal reactivation), payment method updates, invoice downloads, certificate retrieval.
  - Help center coverage: membership assistance, education assistance, mentorship, policy/advocacy, FAQs, toolkits referenced in context Planning.
  - Store access for publications, job ads, sponsorships with member vs non-member pricing and ability to purchase on behalf of others.

## Community & Visibility
  - Member lookup/directory with filters (grade, specialty, chapter) respecting privacy consent; highlight recognition (awards, credentials).
  - Integrate PR/social storytelling to counter perception of outdated organisation and engage younger professionals (Purple Giraffe SWOT).
  - Offer mentorship matching, discussion groups, and future community space hooks per Next Steps > Future.

## Risks & Dependencies
  - Data accuracy depends on syncing CRM, CMS, finance (Stripe/Xero), awards, education; implement validation and escalation workflows.
  - Accessibility and low-click journeys are essential for volunteer-heavy audience; continuous UX testing required.
  - Privacy/GDPR/Spam Act compliance for communications and public directory participation; provide granular opt-outs and audit trails.
