## Goals & Context
  - Support ~1,000 members (engineers, architects, educators, manufacturers, etc.) with a platform that is “more productive and value-driven” for admin, members, and chapters (Spec v3 Who We Are + Objective).
  - Grow/retain membership by clarifying value propositions, simplifying onboarding, and enabling upgrades/renewals as highlighted in context Success Metrics & Marketing plan.
  - Balance national governance with chapter autonomy and BOT-style handover expectations.

## Reference Map
- **Frontend experience**: Membership self-service journeys, low-click dashboards, and corporate modes now live in [Frontend Experience](../2_frontend/2_1_experience.md#membership-self-service-journeys) and [Members Hub](../2_frontend/2_6_members.md).
- **Backend/governance**: Catalog, lifecycle, upgrade, automation, integration, and risk controls are captured under [Super Admin Governance](../4_super_admin/4_1_super_admin.md#membership-operations-oversight).
- **Programs & entitlements**: Education, CPD, awards, and store dependencies are detailed within their respective briefs; ensure membership data contracts remain in sync when those teams iterate.
