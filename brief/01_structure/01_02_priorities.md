# Priorities Framework

## Summary
- Establishes how initiatives are scored on value, effort, difficulty, and urgency so sequencing decisions remain transparent to the board and future vendors.
- Highlights the macro themes (platform integrity, member value, brand reach, governance) that drive High/Mid/Low tiers.

## Purpose
- Provide a consistent decision lens for quarterly and phase planning, ensuring delivery stays aligned with board expectations and BOT commitments.
- Maintain visibility for handover partners—chapters, contractors, new vendors—so they understand why backlogs are ordered the way they are.

## Evaluation Criteria
### 2.3.1 Value
- Measures contribution to membership growth/retention, revenue, advocacy influence, and user experience improvements outlined in context.md.
### 2.3.2 Effort
- Considers relative size spanning design, engineering, content, change management, and cross-vendor coordination.
### 2.3.3 Difficulty
- Captures technical complexity, dependencies on legacy systems (e.g., Monday.com, Approval Max), and regulatory exposure (PCI, privacy).
### 2.3.4 Urgency
- Reflects time pressures such as award cycles, conference deadlines, financial year renewals, or compliance mandates.

## Priority Bands
### 2.4.1 High
- Foundational platform capabilities (CMS schemas, frontend navigation, admin console), revenue-critical flows (multi-currency payments, store, awards, conferences), governance/security (SSO/MFA, audit trails), and experience wins (member hub, knowledgebase access).
### 2.4.2 Mid
- Scaling programs (education depth, CPD roadmap, chapter marketing kits, automation templates) that unlock incremental value once foundations are stable.
### 2.4.3 Low/Future
- Horizon initiatives (community space, advanced personalization, APAC expansion) that should be architected for but can launch post-BOT commitments.

## Themes Influencing Priority
- **Platform & Data Integrity** – headless CMS schemas, analytics lake maturity, integration reliability, and Monday.com migration.
- **Membership & Revenue** – catalog rebuilds, upgrade workflows, ecommerce unification, event/awards monetisation.
- **Brand & Engagement** – rebrand assets, marketing automation, communications preference center, SEO baseline.
- **Governance & Security** – RBAC/SOAR practices, chapter autonomy with guardrails, compliance documentation, training cadence.

## Usage Guidance
- Apply the scoring model during quarterly/phase planning and record rationale within the plan workspace for traceability.
- Reassess after major milestones (CMS launch, conference cycle) to rebalance HQ vs chapter effort.
- Maintain a loop with board portfolios to confirm whether strategic or market shifts warrant reprioritisation.
