Hi David,

Thank you for following up and for your patience, we've just got back from a wedding overseas so we're catching up on things now.

In regards to "Website & CMS Upgrades", this is referring to the backlog of software updates that have built up over the lifetime of the website. The best approach (as with any software) is to keep everything updated as you go, we totally understand that it's not always clear how that works for a website. To pick an example, in this thread we were mostly referring to the version of Sanity CMS you are using (https://www.sanity.io/).  The current version of the CMS is version 1.148.5 which is about three major versions behind the current one (4.12.0) and there are significant changes between the two.

Changes include:

- Refreshed appearance (https://www.sanity.io/docs/changelog/f75445eb-3c3e-4d1e-986d-71a61223aa83)
- Compatibility with Sanity Dashboard (https://www.sanity.io/docs/dashboard)
- Clearer notifications
- Speed & stability improvements
- Media lake for managing assets with asset versioning
- CMS level toggle for viewing drafts vs published content
- Better UI for viewing previous versions, drafts, publishing etc
- CMS Search bar is improved with filters
- Security updates

Continued updates like this keep the website stable in the long term and avoids downtime when something in the chain becomes completely unsupported (in this case the old version of Sanity CMS). Maintenance also keeps ongoing updates efficient, as building on the older version is more difficult and time consuming due to the extra time involved on support, which is why we are recommending them here.

I hope this helps clarify this one, please let us know how you would like to proceed and we can take it from there. 

Cheers,
Joe
