## Roles & Permissions
- Personas include secretariat/admin, finance/accounts, chapter coordinators, volunteer coordinators, and board observers with configurable permission sets and audit logs.
- Allow chapter-managed landing pages while retaining central overrides and approvals coordinated with [Chapters](3_2_chapters.md).

## Legacy Transition
- Migrate Monday.com/Approval Max workflows into the new system with data validation, dual-run strategies, and documented cutovers.
- Track outstanding tasks and change logs so future vendors understand historic decisions.

## Operational Views
- Manage product catalogues (memberships, upgrades, tickets, sponsorships, publications) with purchasing-on-behalf, GST routing, and reconciliation tooling tied to Xero per [Finance & Payments](../6_appendix/6_3_payments.md).
- Surface alerts for failed payments, orphaned invoices, lapsed members, and sponsorship fulfilment deadlines; display dashboards for automation queue health and CMS publishing backlog.
- Provide chapter dashboards highlighting content cadence, events, and revenue contribution with drill-down rights based on RBAC tiers.

## Workflow Orchestration
- Configure award/event forms, juror processes, attendee tracking, sponsorship commitments, refunds, and galleries in partnership with [Awards Operations](3_4_awards.md) and [Events & Conferences Operations](3_5_events.md).
- Mirror legacy Monday.com/Approval Max checklists via workflow engines; log change history for BOT traceability.
- Run communications approvals, template selection, and incident comms in partnership with [Communications](../6_appendix/6_2_communications.md).

## Monitoring & Reporting
- Embed analytics widgets from [Analytics](../6_appendix/6_1_analytics.md) to trigger interventions (e.g., churn spikes, failed imports).
- Maintain historical snapshots, chapter scorecards, SOP repositories, and incident logs for Super Admin oversight.
- Offer export packs mapped to Success Metrics so board portfolios get consistent reporting across phases.

## Dependencies & Next Steps
- Ensure every console module references the shared field dictionary from [Forms Framework](../6_appendix/6_4_forms.md) for data consistency.
- Coordinate permission updates with [Super Admin Governance](../4_super_admin/4_1_super_admin.md) before launch.
