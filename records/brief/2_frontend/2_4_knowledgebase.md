# Objectives
- Provide a centralized knowledgebase covering membership assistance, education assistance, mentorship programs, policy/advocacy, CPD guidance, and FAQs as outlined in context Planning > Architecture.
- Host controlled downloads (free/paid publications, white papers, case studies, toolkits) with gated access tied to membership tiers.

## Content Structure
- Categories: Membership Assistance, Education Assistance, Mentorship, Policy/Advocacy, Technical Standards, CPD Resources, Chapter Toolkits, Marketing Templates, Automation Playbooks (mirrors context Architecture list).
- Content types: articles, checklists, video walkthroughs, slide decks, downloadable PDFs, decision trees, interactive forms.
- Tagging for chapter relevance, member grade, topic, and ESG themes; search filters by region, format, update date.

## Access & Monetization
- Public teasers vs member-only full access; some materials paid (publications) with purchase/download tracking.
- Corporate memberships may unlock additional toolkits or compliance packs.
- Provide versioning and change logs so members know when guidance updates (important for standards/advocacy topics).

## Workflow & Governance
- Editorial workflow with subject-matter experts (e.g., Standards Chair, Education leads) and review cycles.
- Integration with CMS for consistent templating, plus ability to embed knowledgebase links in other pages.
- Collaboration tools for chapters to submit local resources for approval.

## Experience & Search
- Prominent search and browse experience from the member hub; highlight recommended/how-to bundles based on user persona.
- Offer download portal features (quota management, licensing agreements, payment for premium docs).
- Provide accessibility support (screen-reader friendly PDFs, transcripts for videos).

## Considerations
- Need regular maintenance to avoid stale guidance; schedule review cadences.
- Sensitive documents (advocacy/policy drafts) require restricted access and watermarking.
- Large file hosting must be optimized for performance and cost.
