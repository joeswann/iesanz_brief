# Guiding Principles

- Ship in clearly defined phases with demoable increments (Foundation → Experience → Optimisation).
- Measure progress via member, admin, and financial outcomes rather than feature checklists.
- Keep documentation and runbooks in lockstep with build activities to enable smooth transfer to chapters/vendors.
